## AI Models

In order to offer a free tier, Trakkr uses what are known as _fast_ or _mini_ models. These are cheaper and more efficient versions of the models used in interfaces like ChatGPT. These fast models are good in that they provide a proxy for how interfaces like ChatGPT will respond to user queries, but they can differ.

Paid plans (both Growth and Scale) come with access to the advanced models that do actually power interfaces like ChatGPT. This means better tracking accuracy, and results that more closely align with what your customers see.

Paid plans also include support for [Google AI Overviews](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ai-features) and [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/).
