</Info>

Outreach identifies specific articles and publications where getting your brand mentioned would directly improve how AI models understand and recommend you. Based entirely on your Citations data, Outreach shows you which existing articles already influence AI conversations about your industry—and which new articles could be created to fill gaps.

This transforms your citations data into an actionable outreach strategy, showing you exactly where to focus your PR and content marketing efforts for maximum AI visibility impact.

## How Outreach Works

Outreach analyzes all the citations AI models reference when responding to prompts about your industry (from the Citations feature). It then identifies:

**Existing Articles**: High-authority articles that already influence AI conversations about your space, but don't mention your brand. Getting included in these articles would immediately improve your AI visibility.

**New Articles**: Article concepts that don't exist yet but would fill gaps in AI model knowledge about your industry. These represent opportunities to pitch new content to relevant publications.

For each opportunity, Outreach provides:

- Pitch templates you can customize and send
- Expected impact on your AI visibility
- Step-by-step instructions for approaching the publication
- Verified contact information (when available)

## Understanding Outreach Opportunities

Navigate between two main tabs to explore different opportunity types:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Existing Articles">
    Articles that already exist and influence AI conversations about your industry, but don't currently mention your brand.

    **Why these matter**: These articles are already being cited by AI models. Getting your brand added to them provides immediate visibility in established, authoritative content that AI models trust.

    **Your goal**: Reach out to the publication or author to get your brand included in an update or revision of the article.

    ![Screenshot2025 11 06at19 26 34 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-11-06at19.26.34.png)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="New Articles">
    Article concepts that would influence AI conversations but don't exist yet in any publication.

    **Why these matter**: These represent gaps in the content landscape—topics AI models need better information about. Creating these articles establishes you as an authority and gets your brand into new citations.

    **Your goal**: Pitch these article ideas to relevant publications. The publication writes the article and naturally includes your brand as a key player or source.

## Managing Opportunities with Status

Track your outreach progress by updating opportunity status:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="New" icon="sparkles" color="#0e9373">
    Opportunities you haven't acted on yet. Default status for all new opportunities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="In Progress" icon="clock" color="#0e9373">
    Opportunities you're actively pursuing—reached out, waiting for response, in conversations, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Won" icon="trophy" color="#0e9373">
    Successfully placed opportunities where your brand is now mentioned or will be mentioned soon.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hidden" icon="eye-slash" color="#0e9373">
    Opportunities you've decided not to pursue. Removes from default view to reduce clutter.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Changing Status

Click the status badge on any opportunity card to open a dropdown menu with all status options. Select the new status to update.

### Filtering by Status

Use the "Default view" dropdown in the top right to filter opportunities:

- **Default view**: Shows New and In Progress opportunities (your active pipeline)
- **New Opportunities**: Only shows brand new opportunities you haven't acted on
- **In Progress**: Only shows opportunities you're currently working
- **Won**: Shows your successful placements
- **Hidden**: Shows opportunities you've chosen to hide

This helps you focus on relevant opportunities at each stage of your outreach process.

## Strategic Use of Outreach

### Prioritize by Fit Score and Priority

Not all opportunities are equal. Focus first on:

- **High fit score (70+)**: Extremely relevant to your brand and industry
- **High priority (7+)**: Significant impact potential
- **Low difficulty**: Easier to execute successfully

These are your best "return on effort" opportunities.

### Start with Existing Articles

Existing articles often provide faster wins because:

- The content already exists and is proven to influence AI models
- Authors may be receptive to updates with new information
- You can offer timely data, quotes, or corrections
- Articles already have traffic and authority

### Target Low Difficulty Opportunities First

Low difficulty opportunities might include:

- Publications you have existing relationships with
- Articles on topics where you have unique data or expertise
- Smaller, more accessible publications
- Opportunities where you can provide clear value (test results, expert commentary, etc.)

Build momentum with wins before tackling harder opportunities.

### Batch Similar Opportunities

Group opportunities by:

- Publication type (industry blogs, news sites, research publications, etc.)
- Topic or angle (product reviews, comparison guides, technical deep-dives, etc.)
- Required approach (data contributions, expert quotes, product samples, etc.)

This lets you refine your pitch and process for similar opportunities rather than starting fresh each time.

### Use Pitch Templates as Starting Points

The provided pitch templates are designed for each specific opportunity, but always:

- **Personalize** with specific details about your brand's unique angle
- **Research** the publication's recent content and style
- **Update** with current information and timely hooks
- **Customize** the subject line to stand out in their inbox

Generic, un-personalized pitches rarely succeed. Use templates as frameworks, not final copy.

### Track Everything

Move opportunities through status stages:

1. **New → In Progress**: When you send your first outreach email
2. **In Progress → Won**: When they agree to include you or publish your contribution
3. **In Progress → Hidden**: When they decline or it's not a good fit

This helps you:

- See what's working and what's not
- Avoid double-contacting the same opportunity
- Track success rates across different opportunity types
- Understand which approaches yield results

## Best Practices

**Don't spray and pray**

Focus on 5-10 high-quality opportunities at a time rather than mass-emailing hundreds of publications. Personalized, thoughtful outreach converts better.

**Provide genuine value**

Publications want content that serves their readers. Frame your pitch around what you can contribute (data, expertise, unique perspective) rather than what you want (a mention, a link).

**Follow up strategically**

If you don't hear back within a week, send one polite follow-up. If still no response, mark as Hidden and move on. Persistence is good; being annoying is not.

**Leverage existing relationships**

Prioritize publications where you have contacts, previous coverage, or warm introductions. These convert at much higher rates than cold outreach.

**Time your pitches**

Some opportunities are time-sensitive:

- Seasonal content (gear guides, holiday roundups)
- News-driven articles (responding to industry changes)
- Annual updates (yearly "best of" lists)

Check article publish dates and plan outreach accordingly.

**Prepare supporting materials**

Before reaching out, have ready:

- High-res product images
- Spec sheets or data points
- Executive bios and headshots
- Case studies or customer testimonials
- Technical details or testing data

This speeds up the process when publications show interest.

**Track what works**

Note which types of opportunities, pitches, and approaches lead to Won status. Double down on what's working.

**Monitor won opportunities**

After successfully placing your brand in an article, monitor:

- When the article goes live or gets updated
- Whether your brand is actually mentioned as expected
- If the article starts appearing in your Citations data

This validates that your outreach is actually improving AI visibility.

## Understanding Difficulty Levels

**Low Difficulty**

Opportunities where you have advantages:

- Publications you've worked with before
- Topics where you have exclusive data or expertise
- Smaller, more accessible publications
- Clear value proposition for inclusion

**Medium Difficulty**

Standard competitive opportunities:

- Mid-tier publications
- Topics with multiple valid expert sources
- Articles that would require moderate effort to update
- Publications with established but accessible processes

**High Difficulty**

Challenging opportunities:

- Top-tier, highly selective publications
- Highly competitive topic areas
- Articles that would require significant rewrites
- Publications with very high barriers to entry

High difficulty doesn't mean impossible—just that these require more strategic planning, stronger pitches, and often leverage existing relationships or exceptional circumstances.

## Connecting Outreach to Citations

Outreach opportunities come directly from your Citations data. This means:

**Every opportunity is proven**: These articles are already influencing AI models—you're not guessing what might work.

**Impact is measurable**: After getting placed, watch for the article to appear in your Citations data with your brand mentioned.

**Priority is data-driven**: Opportunities are ranked based on actual AI model behavior, not assumptions about what "should" matter.

**Topics are relevant**: Since opportunities are based on prompts about your industry, they're naturally aligned with what AI models need to know about your space.

Think of Citations as showing you the problem (what influences AI models but doesn't mention you) and Outreach as providing the solution (specific actions to get mentioned).

## Common Use Cases

### Building Initial Authority

If you're a newer brand with limited citations:

1. Focus on New Articles opportunities—get your brand into content being created from scratch
2. Target smaller, accessible publications first to build a portfolio
3. Offer unique data or testing results that publications can't get elsewhere
4. Use Won placements as social proof for approaching bigger publications

### Competitive Displacement

If competitors dominate certain citations:

1. Find Existing Articles where competitors are mentioned but you're not
2. Offer updated information, newer data, or different perspectives
3. Pitch New Articles that change the narrative in your favor
4. Target articles that appear frequently in your most important prompts

### Category Leadership

If you want to be the go-to authority:

1. Focus on high-fit, high-priority opportunities even if difficult
2. Contribute to comprehensive guides and comparison articles
3. Offer yourself as an expert source for quotes and commentary
4. Create thought leadership content that publications want to reference

### Seasonal or Campaign-Driven

For specific initiatives or launches:

1. Filter for opportunities related to your campaign topic
2. Time outreach to coincide with product launches or announcements
3. Offer exclusive information or early access
4. Use timely news hooks to increase pitch relevance
