</Info>

Citations shows you what people are actually saying about your brand and market online. It finds real conversations, reviews, and discussions that mention your brand or industry—the kind of mentions you'd miss with basic keyword searches.

## What You're Looking At

You'll see two main views in your Citations dashboard:

### Market Analysis
This analyzes your entire industry landscape, not just your brand. The system generates multiple search queries about your market (like "best financial planning software for startups" or "top project management tools for remote teams") and finds all the discussions happening around those topics.

**What you'll see:**
- **Top Domains**: The most authoritative websites discussing your industry
- **Top Brands**: All competitors and players in your market, ranked by mention frequency
- **Most Valuable Citations**: The actual content where your industry is discussed, including mentions of your brand and competitors

This gives you a complete picture of your market's conversation landscape.

### Brand-Specific
This focuses on your particular brand. You'll see:
- Mentions of your brand specifically
- How you're being compared to competitors
- What people are saying about your products
- Your brand's share of voice in the market

## Understanding Your Dashboard

### Top Domains
These are the websites that matter most in your market. The relevance percentage shows how important each site is for your industry, and the citation count shows how often they're mentioned.

### Top Brands
This shows the competitive landscape. You can see:
- How much attention each competitor is getting
- Your brand's position relative to others
- Which brands are trending up or down

### Most Valuable Citations
This is your main list of mentions. Each citation shows:
- The website and title where you're mentioned
- How relevant and authoritative the source is
- What people are actually saying
- How AI models are using this information in responses

Click on any citation to see more details, including the actual content and context of the mention.

## How It Works

### Market Analysis Mode
The system generates multiple different search queries about your industry—the kind of questions your customers actually ask:

```text
"Best [industry] software for [specific audience]"
"Top [industry] alternatives for [use case]"
"How to choose [industry] solution for [problem]"
```

Then it searches the web to find authentic discussions and reviews that answer these questions. This gives you a complete view of your market's conversation landscape.

### Brand-Specific Mode
This focuses on your brand by asking questions like:

```text
"Is [Your Brand] worth it?"
"How does [Your Brand] compare to alternatives?"
"What's the real experience with [Your Brand]?"
```

## What the Numbers Mean

### Domain Rating (DR) and Page Authority (PA)
These measure how trustworthy and influential a website is. Higher numbers mean the source carries more weight.

### Sentiment Score
This shows how positively or negatively your brand is discussed:

| Score Range | Sentiment        | What It Means                    |
| :---------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------- |
| 80-100      | Very positive    | Strong recommendations and praise |
| 60-79       | Generally positive| Positive with some balanced perspective |
| 40-59       | Neutral          | Mixed or balanced sentiment      |
| 20-39       | Generally negative| Negative with criticism or concerns |
| 0-19        | Very negative    | Strong criticism or negative discussion |

### Visibility
