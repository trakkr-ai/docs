Trakkr is the most sophisticated AI visibility platform on the market, built specifically for agencies managing multiple client brands. As the leading platform in AI search tracking, Trakkr provides the depth and flexibility agencies need to deliver real results for clients.

<Note>
  Trakkr tracks how AI models rank and mention brands across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and 3 other major platforms. Think of it as "SEO for AI."
</Note>

## Why Agencies Use Trakkr

**Manage Your Entire Portfolio Efficiently**
The Brand Comparison dashboard shows all client performance in one view. Quickly identify which clients need attention, track progress across your book of business, and allocate team resources effectively.

**Demonstrate Clear ROI**
Show clients exactly how your work translates to improved AI visibility. Before/after scores, competitive positioning changes, and citation growth prove the value of your services with concrete metrics.

**Differentiate Your Services**
Most agencies can't answer "How does AI see our brand?" Trakkr gives you unique insights into citations powering AI responses and specific outreach opportunities to improve visibility, capabilities your competitors don't have.

**Scale Without Adding Overhead**
Track 10 clients for $399/month with unlimited team members. API access, automated reporting, and portfolio management tools mean you can grow client count without proportionally growing operational costs.

## What Makes Trakkr Different

Trakkr doesn't just track rankings. It shows you the actual sources powering AI responses. When ChatGPT or Claude answers a question about your client's industry, they reference specific articles, reviews, and websites. Trakkr tracks which sources AI models cite, which competitors are mentioned in high-authority content, and exactly where your clients are missing.

Then Outreach turns those insights into action. For each citation opportunity, you get pitch templates, verified contact information, expected impact on visibility, and step-by-step instructions. It's the difference between knowing which sources matter and actually getting your clients into them.

The Scale plan's 10 brand slots let you track your client's main brand plus their 9 top competitors as separate brands, giving you comprehensive market intelligence that most platforms can't provide.

## What We Track

Trakkr tracks how AI models rank and mention your clients' brands across 6 major platforms: OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, xAI Grok, DeepSeek, and Meta Llama.

For each client, you get a **Visibility Score (0-100)** showing how prominently the brand appears when mentioned, and a **Presence Score (0-100%)** indicating what percentage of relevant AI queries mention the brand. You can see where clients rank vs. competitors, which sites AI models reference when discussing the brand, and how AI perceives the brand's positioning.
