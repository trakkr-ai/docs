Trakkr is built for agencies managing multiple client brands. As the most advanced AI visibility platform, it provides the depth and flexibility you need to deliver real results.

<Note>
  Trakkr tracks how AI models rank and mention brands across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and 3 other major platforms. Think of it as ["SEO for AI."](/getting-started)
</Note>

## Why Agencies Choose Trakkr

**Portfolio Management** - Brand Comparison dashboard shows all client performance in one view. Identify which clients need attention and allocate team resources effectively.

**Unique Differentiation** - Most agencies can't answer "How does AI see our brand?" You get unique insights into [citations](/citations) powering AI responses and specific [outreach opportunities](/outreach), capabilities your competitors don't have.

**Scale Economics** - Track 10 clients for \$399/month with unlimited team members. Grow client count without proportionally growing operational costs.

## What Makes Trakkr Different

Trakkr doesn't just track rankings. It shows you the actual sources powering AI responses. When ChatGPT or Claude answers a question about your client's industry, they reference specific articles, reviews, and websites. Trakkr tracks which sources AI models cite, which competitors are mentioned in high-authority content, and exactly where your clients are missing.

Then [Outreach](/outreach) turns those insights into action. For each citation opportunity, you get pitch templates, verified contact information, expected impact on visibility, and step-by-step instructions. It's the difference between knowing which sources matter and actually getting your clients into them.

The Scale plan's 10 brand slots let you track your client's main brand plus their 9 top competitors as separate brands, giving you comprehensive market intelligence that most platforms can't provide.

## What We Track

Trakkr tracks how AI models rank and mention your clients' brands across 6 major platforms: OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, xAI Grok, DeepSeek, and Meta Llama.

For each client, you get a **Visibility Score (0-100)** showing how prominently the brand appears when mentioned, and a **Presence Score (0-100%)** indicating what percentage of relevant AI queries mention the brand. You can see where clients rank vs. competitors, which sites AI models reference when discussing the brand, and how AI perceives the brand's positioning.
