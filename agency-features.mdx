<Info>
  Agency features are available exclusively on the Scale plan and require [Teams](/teams) to be set up. [Upgrade to access](/plans)
</Info>

## Overview

Agency features are designed for marketing agencies managing multiple client brands. These tools help you compare performance across your portfolio and create compelling demo dashboards when pitching to prospective clients.

<Warning>
  Only enable agency features if you're actually working in an agency. These tools add UI elements specifically for multi-client workflows that may be unnecessary for single-brand users.
</Warning>

## Enabling Agency Features

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your team">
    Ensure you're on the Scale plan and have created your team. See the [Teams documentation](/teams) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Team tab">
    Go to **My Account** and select the **Team** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable agency features">
    Click **Enable agency features**. This adds an "Agency" section to your sidebar with Brand Comparison and My Demos tools.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once enabled, you'll see a new **Agency** section at the bottom of your left sidebar with two features:

- **Brand Comparison**
- **My Demos**

## Brand Comparison

View and compare key metrics across all brands your team manages in a single, comprehensive table.

### What's Included

The Brand Comparison table shows:

- **Brand**: Brand name and logo
- **Prompts**: Number of active prompts being tracked
- **Research**: Status of Prompt Research (or number of prompts found)
- **Visibility**: Current Visibility score
- **Technical Score**: Technical audit score
- **Content Score**: Content optimization score
- **Competitors**: Competitive ranking and total competitors tracked

## My Demos

Create realistic mock Trakkr dashboards to show prospective clients what their AI visibility could look like with your services.

### Creating a Demo Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to My Demos">
    Click **Agency** in your sidebar, then select **My Demos**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter main brand details">
    Fill in:

    - **Main brand name**: The prospect you're pitching (e.g., "Nike")
    - **Main brand URL**: Their website URL (e.g., "nike.com")
    - **Visibility**: Set their mock Visibility score (0-100)

    The brand's favicon will automatically appear once you enter a valid URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add competitors">
    Add up to 2 competitors:

    - **Competitor name**: Competitor brand name
    - **Competitor URL**: Their website
    - **Visibility**: Set their mock score relative to the main brand

    Use these scores strategically to show the prospect where they stand vs. competitors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add example prompts">
    Enter 3 sample prompts relevant to the prospect's industry. These appear in the demo dashboard to make it look realistic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create demo">
    Click **Create Demo**. The demo dashboard generates with simulated data based on the visibility scores you set.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Demo Dashboard Features

The generated demo dashboard includes:

- **Realistic Visibility scores** based on your input
- **Mock daily reports** showing simulated tracking
- **Competitor comparisons** with the visibility scores you configured
- **Example prompts** you provided
- **Simulated metrics** across all Trakkr features

<Note>
  **All data in demo dashboards is simulated**. It's designed to look realistic for pitching but doesn't reflect actual AI tracking data.
</Note>

### Managing Saved Demos

All created demos appear in the **Saved demos** section below the creation form. For each saved demo, you can:

- **View demo**: Open the full demo dashboard
- **Delete**: Permanently remove the demo

<Warning>
  Demos cannot be edited after creation. If you need to change visibility scores, competitors, or other details, delete the demo and create a new one.
</Warning>

### Demo Strategy Tips

**Adjust visibility scores strategically:**

- Show the prospect slightly behind competitors to demonstrate opportunity
- Set their score too low to create urgency
- Or show them leading to validate their current efforts and upsell optimization

**Choose relevant competitors:**

- Use their actual market competitors for credibility
- Select competitors they're actively trying to beat
- Include industry leaders to show aspirational positioning

**Write realistic prompts:**

- Use questions their target customers would actually ask
- Focus on their core products or services
- Make prompts specific to their industry

**Present professionally:**

- Walk prospects through the demo dashboard live
- Explain what each metric means for their business
- Use the demo as a conversation starter, not just a visual aid
