The Competitors page is where Trakkr's magic really happens. While other tools show you basic metrics about your own performance, we're giving you something completely different: the first-ever comprehensive view of how your brand actually stacks up in AI conversations against your competition. You'll see exactly how AI models rank you versus competitors, which brands they consider most authoritative, and where your biggest opportunities lie.

The page has four main sections: **Summary**, **Trends**, **Prompts**, and **Models**. Let's walk through what each one reveals.

## Summary View

Think of this as your competitive landscape at a glance. It pulls from all your historical data to show where you stand right now.

### Total mentions

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 43 06 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.43.06.png)

This chart shows how often each brand appears in AI responses across all your tracked prompts.

**What you're seeing**: Raw mention counts for each brand. Taller bars mean more frequent mentions.

**What it means**: This is your "share of voice" in AI conversations. The brands with the tallest bars are getting the most airtime when AI models discuss topics in your space.

**Why it matters**: You can instantly spot the dominant players and see how your brand's overall visibility compares. If your bar is short, you're getting overlooked by AI models.

### Average rank

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 43 12 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.43.12.png)

This shows the average ranking position for each brand when they do get mentioned.

**What you're seeing**: Lower bars (and lower numbers) are better here. An average rank of #1 means that models consistently rank your brand first when queried with your prompts.

**What it means**: This separates popularity from authority. A brand might get mentioned a lot but always appear at the bottom of lists. This chart shows you who AI models actually consider the most credible and authoritative.

**Why it matters**: A low average rank signals a strong, trusted brand. If your average rank is high (meaning you're usually ranked low), this is an indicator to build more authority in your space.

### Rank distributions

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 43 23 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.43.23.png)

This breaks down how consistently a brand performs across different ranking tiers. Pick any brand from the dropdown to analyze their pattern compared to yours.

**What you're seeing**: The percentage of time a brand ranked #1, in positions 2-3, 4-5, 6-10, or didn't get ranked at all.

**What it means**: You can see if a competitor is consistently dominant or just gets lucky sometimes. A big "Rank #1" bar means they're a consistent leader. A big "Not Ranked" bar means they're a fringe player.

**Why it matters**: This helps you figure out which competitors are your real threats. Are they dominating the top spots consistently, or do they just have a few good moments? Focus your competitive efforts on the consistent performers.

### Competitor overlap

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 43 31 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.43.31.png)

This is where things get really interesting—it shows how often other brands appear in the same AI responses as yours.

**What you're seeing**: A detailed breakdown for each competitor with three key metrics.

**What it means**:

- **Number of overlaps**: How many times you and this competitor were mentioned together
- **Overlap rate**: What percentage of your mentions also included them (91% means they showed up in 91% of your mentions)
- **Position above rate**: The big one—when you're both mentioned, how often are you ranked above them

**Why it matters**: This answers the ultimate question: "When we're both in the running, who wins?" A competitor with a low position above rate beats you every single time you go head-to-head. That's your primary threat right there.

## Trends View

Now we're looking at how the competitive landscape shifts over time. This is where you spot momentum changes and measure the impact of your marketing efforts.

### Mentions over time

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 51 51 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.51.51.png)

Track daily mention counts for your brand and competitors over time.

**What you're seeing**: Each line represents a brand's daily mentions. Rising lines mean growing share of voice.

**What it means**: You can watch the competitive dynamics play out in real-time. When lines cross, market position is shifting.

**Why it matters**: Connect the dots between your marketing activities and results. Did that product launch cause your competitor's mentions to spike? Is your content strategy driving steady growth in your line?

### Rankings over time

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 51 51 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.51.51.png)

See how average rankings change day by day for each brand.

**What you're seeing**: Daily average ranks over time. Remember, lower lines are better here.

**What it means**: A downward trend for your brand is great news—you're building authority. An upward trend for competitors means they're losing ground.

**Why it matters**: This shows whether your long-term brand-building efforts are actually working. Are you successfully climbing the rankings in AI models' minds?

## Prompts View

Here's where you get tactical. See exactly which topics you're winning on and where you're missing opportunities.

### Prompt winners

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 53 23 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.53.23.png)

Your strongest competitive advantages, ranked by how often you take the #1 spot.

**What you're seeing**: Your prompts ordered by "Rank #1 Rate"—the percentage of AI models that put you first.

**What it means**: The prompts at the top are where you absolutely dominate. These are your competitive strengths.

**Why it matters**: Double down on these topics. They're proof that your expertise is recognized by AI models, so amplify this advantage across all your marketing channels.

### Breakdown by prompt

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 54 10 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.54.10.png)

Drill down into any single prompt to see the full competitive picture for that query.

**What you're seeing**: Pick a prompt and see everyone's #1 ranking rate for that specific topic.

**What it means**: A focused competitive snapshot for one particular user intent or topic.

**Why it matters**: If you're losing on a commercially important prompt, this shows you exactly who's winning and how consistently. Time to study their approach.

### Prompt opportunities

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 54 33 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.54.33.png)

Your roadmap for growth—prompts where you're underperforming and who you need to beat.

**What you're seeing**: Prompts where you're not ranking well (or at all), plus who the current winners are.

**What it means**: These are your untapped opportunities. The "Best performers" column shows exactly who you need to study and outmaneuver.

**Why it matters**: This is your content strategy blueprint. Target these topics to expand your reach and steal market share from competitors.

## Models View

Not all AI models see your brand the same way. This section reveals how different AI platforms perceive your competitive position.

### Average rank by model

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 56 44 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.56.44.png)

See your ranking performance over time, but filtered to show data from just one AI model at a time.

**What you're seeing**: The same rankings-over-time chart, but focused on whichever AI model you select.

**What it means**: You might discover that ChatGPT loves your brand but Claude consistently ranks you lower.

**Why it matters**: AI models aren't a monolith—they have different "personalities" and preferences. This helps you develop targeted strategies for each platform.

### Comparison by model

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 57 28 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.57.28.png)

Go head-to-head with any competitor, broken down by each AI model.

**What you're seeing**: Pick a competitor and see your mentions and average rank versus theirs on each AI platform. Your wins are highlighted.

**What it means**: Quickly see which platforms favor you versus your competitor.

**Why it matters**: This answers "Where am I beating Competitor X, and where are they beating me?" Essential for targeted competitive strategy.

### Variations between models

![Screenshot2025 06 09at08 58 49 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-06-09at08.58.49.png)

The most detailed view—your exact rank for every prompt on every AI model.

**What you're seeing**: A comprehensive table showing your specific rank for each prompt across all AI models. A '0' means you weren't mentioned.

**What it means**: Spot the inconsistencies. Why does Anthropic rank you #1 but Meta ranks you #9 for the same query?

**Why it matters**: This is for deep diagnostics. Understanding each AI model's unique preferences lets you optimize your content for maximum impact across all platforms.
