## Key Features

### High-Volume Prompt Tracking

Enterprise plans support tracking 1,000+ prompts per brand, enabling comprehensive coverage across all AI models. This is essential for large brands that need to monitor visibility across:
- Product categories
- Service offerings
- Geographic markets
- Competitive positioning
- Industry-specific queries

### Custom APIs & Webhooks

Build production-grade integrations with full API access and webhook support. Enterprise customers can:
- Pull data into internal dashboards
- Trigger automated workflows
- Integrate with existing tech stacks
- Build custom reporting solutions

See the [API documentation](/api-reference/introduction) for technical details.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Enterprise-grade security with SAML/OIDC support through WorkOS. Compatible with:
- Okta
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Google Workspace
- Ping Identity
- OneLogin
- JumpCloud
- Any OIDC or SAML-compliant identity provider

**Setup requirements:**
- Federated email domains
- IdP configuration (OIDC recommended)
- Group-to-role mapping preferences
- 2-3 test accounts (including one admin)
- IT/security contact for certificate management

SSO provisioning typically takes about one week after IdP details are provided.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I add more brands later, and how is pricing handled?">
    Yes—add brands at any time. The plan includes 1 brand; each additional brand is $499/month. All brands share your integrations, APIs, webhooks, and data retention settings. Pricing updates automatically when you add or remove brands.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Enterprise SSO work on Trakkr, and what should we know before signing up?">
    Trakkr uses WorkOS for SSO with major identity providers (OIDC or SAML). We support SP-initiated and IdP-initiated sign-in, with options for Just-In-Time user creation or SCIM/Directory Sync for automated provisioning. SSO is an add-on at $500 one-time + $249/month, typically provisioned within one week after IdP details are provided. We request minimal attributes (email, name, optionally groups for role mapping) and never store passwords.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's involved in the strategic consulting?">
    Trakkr partners with Visum Labs to deliver white-glove rollout and onboarding tailored to your stack. This includes prompt discovery and configuration to surface high-value queries, ongoing monitoring and management of tracked prompts, and technical implementation of a crawler-focused AI version of your site integrated with Cloudflare. Visum handles hands-on technical support with seamless updates as AI and search platforms evolve.
