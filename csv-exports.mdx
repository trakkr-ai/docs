## Tips for Working with CSV Exports

- **Charts**: Create time-series charts to visualize visibility and presence trends
- **Filtering**: Filter by date range, prompt, or model to focus on specific insights

### Combining Export Types

Consider using multiple export types for comprehensive analysis:

1. **Top-Level** for overall trend visualization
2. **Detailed** for prompt-specific optimization
3. **Raw Data** for competitive intelligence

### Automation

For automated data pipelines, consider using the [API](/api) or [Google Sheets sync](/google-sheets) instead of manual CSV exports.

## Troubleshooting

### Export Taking Too Long

Exports typically complete within 30 seconds. If an export takes longer:
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page to see if the export has completed
- Try creating a new export if the first attempt fails

### Missing Data

If your export appears incomplete:
- Ensure you have tracking data for the selected time period
- Verify that prompts are active and running
- Check that you're on a paid plan (required for exports)

### File Format Issues

If you encounter issues opening CSV files:
- Ensure you're using a compatible application (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.)
- Check that the file extension is `.csv`
- Try opening with a text editor to verify the file structure
