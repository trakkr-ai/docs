# Quick Start Guide

Get your first AI brand tracking report in just a few minutes. This guide walks you through Trakkr's setup process and helps you understand your results.

<Note>
  This same process applies whether you're setting up your first brand or adding additional brands to track.
</Note>

## The Setup Process

When you first sign up or add a new brand, Trakkr guides you through a 5-step setup process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reading Your Site">
    Trakkr analyzes your website to understand your brand and industry context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Brand Information">
    Confirm your brand name and description
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Prompts">
    Select or create prompts relevant to your industry
  </Step>
  <Step title="Running Your First Report">
    Trakkr queries AI models with your prompts (takes about 30 seconds)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Complete">
    Your dashboard is ready with your first report data
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1: Website Analysis

Trakkr automatically reads and analyzes your website to:

- Understand your industry and business context
- Identify relevant keywords and topics
- Suggest appropriate prompts for tracking

This step happens automatically when you provide your website URL.

## Step 2: Brand Information

### Brand Name

Enter your primary brand name exactly as you want it tracked:

- Use your official brand name (e.g., "Nike", "Salesforce", "Shopify")
- Avoid taglines or descriptive text
- Match how customers typically refer to your company

### Brand Description

Provide a brief description of what your company does. This helps Trakkr:

- Suggest relevant industry prompts
- Better understand your competitive landscape
- Improve tracking accuracy

## Step 3: Choosing Your Prompts

Trakkr will suggest prompts based on your website analysis, or you can create custom ones.

### Pre-suggested Prompts

Based on your industry, you'll see relevant prompts like:

- "What are the best [your industry] tools for teams?"
- "Top 10 [your category] solutions for small businesses"
- "Best [your product type] for [target audience]"

### Creating Custom Prompts

If you want to add your own prompts, follow these guidelines:

**Good Prompt Examples:**

- "What are the best project management tools for teams?"
- "Top CRM software solutions for small businesses"
- "Best running shoe brands for marathons"
- "Most reliable email marketing platforms"

**Avoid These:**

- Prompts too specific to your brand ("Why is [YourBrand] the best?")
- Yes/no questions that don't generate lists
- Overly narrow queries that won't mention competitors

<Tip>
  Start with 3-5 broad prompts that cover different aspects of your industry. You can always add more later in the Prompts section.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Your First Report Generation

Once you've set up your prompts, Trakkr immediately runs your first report:

- **Queries 6 AI models** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Meta)
- **Takes about 30 seconds** to complete
- **Analyzes all responses** and calculates your scores
- **Identifies competitors** mentioned alongside your brand

<Note>
  This initial report gives you immediate results. Going forward, reports will run automatically every day.
</Note>

## Step 5: Understanding Your Results

Your dashboard will immediately show:

### Overview Metrics

**Visibility Score (0-100)**

- How prominently your brand appears when mentioned
- Higher scores = better positioning in AI responses
- Based on your ranking across all prompts and models

**Presence Score (0-100%)**

- What percentage of queries mention your brand
- Your "share of voice" in AI conversations
- Shows how often AI models think of your brand

### Dashboard Sections

## Interpreting Your First Results

### Strong Performance Indicators

- **Visibility Score 70\+** - You appear prominently when mentioned
- **Presence Score 50%\+** - Good share of voice in your industry
- **Top 3 rankings** - AI models consistently rank you highly
- **Multiple model mentions** - You appear across different platforms

### Areas to Investigate

- **Low visibility, high presence** - You're mentioned but not prominently
- **High visibility, low presence** - You rank well but aren't mentioned often
- **Missing from key prompts** - Consider why AI models don't mention you
- **Strong competitors** - Analyze what competitors are doing differently

## After Setup: Next Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor Daily Reports">
    Check your dashboard regularly as new reports generate automatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Competitors" stepNumber={2}>
    Study which competitors appear most frequently and in what contexts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Trends" stepNumber={3}>
    Watch how your scores change over time to measure improvement
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common First-Time Questions

### "Why didn't my brand appear in some prompts?"

This is normal and can happen for several reasons:

- **Prompts may be too broad** - Try more specific industry questions
- **Brand recognition** - Newer or niche brands may have lower AI awareness
- **Different naming** - AI might know you by a variation of your name
- **Market positioning** - You might not be top-of-mind for those specific queries

### "How often do new reports run?"

- **Daily automatic reports** after your initial setup
- **New prompts** are included in the next day's report
- **Historical data** builds over time to show trends

### "Can I add more prompts later?"

Not currently - but we're working on adding this\!
