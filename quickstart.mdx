## The Setup Process

When you first sign up or add a new brand, Trakkr guides you through a 5-step setup process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reading Your Site">
    Trakkr analyzes your website to understand your brand and industry context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Brand Information">
    Confirm your brand name and description
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Prompts">
    Select or create prompts relevant to your industry
  </Step>
  <Step title="Running Your First Report">
    Trakkr queries AI models with your prompts (takes about 30 seconds)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Complete">
    Your dashboard is ready with your first report data
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1: Website Analysis

Trakkr automatically reads and analyzes your website to:

- Understand your industry and business context
- Identify relevant keywords and topics
- Suggest appropriate prompts for tracking

This step happens automatically when you provide your website URL.

## Step 2: Brand Information

### Brand Name

Enter your primary brand name exactly as you want it tracked:

- Use your official brand name (e.g., "Nike", "Salesforce", "Shopify")
- Avoid taglines or descriptive text
- Match how customers typically refer to your company

### Brand Description

Provide a brief description of what your company does. This helps Trakkr:

- Suggest relevant industry prompts
- Better understand your competitive landscape
- Improve tracking accuracy

## Step 3: Choosing Your Prompts

Trakkr will suggest prompts based on your website analysis, or you can create custom ones.

### Pre-suggested Prompts

Based on your industry, you'll see relevant prompts like:

- "What are the best [your industry] tools for teams?"
- "Top 10 [your category] solutions for small businesses"
- "Best [your product type] for [target audience]"

### Creating Custom Prompts

If you want to add your own prompts, follow these guidelines:

**Good Prompt Examples:**

- "What are the best project management tools for teams?"
- "Top CRM software solutions for small businesses"
- "Best running shoe brands for marathons"
- "Most reliable email marketing platforms"

**Avoid These:**

- Prompts too specific to your brand ("Why is [YourBrand] the best?")
- Yes/no questions that don't generate lists
- Overly narrow queries that won't mention competitors

<Tip>
  Start with 3-5 broad prompts that cover different aspects of your industry. You can always add more later. See [Working with Prompts](/working-with-prompts) for detailed guidance on creating effective queries.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Your First Report Generation

Once you've set up your prompts, Trakkr immediately runs your first report:

- **Queries 6 AI models** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Meta)
- **Takes about 30 seconds** to complete
- **Analyzes all responses** and calculates your [Visibility and Presence scores](/understanding-scores)
- **Identifies competitors** mentioned alongside your brand (explore them on the [Competitors page](/competitors))

<Note>
  This initial report gives you immediate results. Going forward, reports will run automatically every day.
</Note>

## Step 5: Understanding Your Results

Your dashboard will immediately show:

### Overview Metrics

These are the two most important metrics Trakkr tracks. Learn more in [Understanding Scores](/understanding-scores).

**Visibility Score (0-100)**

- How prominently your brand appears when mentioned
- Higher scores = better positioning in AI responses
- Based on your ranking across all prompts and models
- Score of 70+ indicates strong positioning

**Presence Score (0-100%)**

- What percentage of queries mention your brand
- Your "share of voice" in AI conversations
- Shows how often AI models think of your brand
- Score of 50%+ indicates good market recognition

### Dashboard Sections

Explore these key areas of your Trakkr dashboard:

## Interpreting Your First Results

### Strong Performance Indicators

- **Visibility Score 70+** - You appear prominently when mentioned
- **Presence Score 50%+** - Good share of voice in your industry
- **Top 3 rankings** - AI models consistently rank you highly
- **Multiple model mentions** - You appear across different platforms

### Areas to Investigate

- **Low visibility, high presence** - You're mentioned but not prominently. Focus on improving content quality and authority to boost rankings.
- **High visibility, low presence** - You rank well but aren't mentioned often. Consider adding more prompts or running [Prompt Research](/prompt-research) to find relevant queries.
- **Missing from key prompts** - Consider why AI models don't mention you. A [Technical Audit](/technical-audit) can identify crawlability issues.
- **Strong competitors** - Analyze what competitors are doing differently using the [Competitors page](/competitors) to understand their strategy.

## After Setup: Your First Week with Trakkr

Now that you have your first report, here's how to get the most value from Trakkr in your first week:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Day 1-2: Understand Your Baseline">
    Review your [Visibility and Presence scores](/understanding-scores) and identify your current competitive position. Check the [Reading Reports guide](/reading-reports) to understand all the metrics available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Day 3-4: Analyze the Competition">
    Dive into the [Competitors page](/competitors) to see who appears alongside your brand and how you rank against them. Look for patterns in who consistently outranks you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Day 5-6: Optimize Your Prompts">
    Review which prompts perform well and which don't. Read [Working with Prompts](/working-with-prompts) to refine your tracking strategy and ensure you're monitoring the right queries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Day 7: Plan Your Strategy">
    Based on your first week's data, identify 2-3 areas to focus on. Consider running [Prompt Research](/prompt-research) to discover more queries your audience asks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Don't expect immediate changes in your scores. AI visibility is a long-term game. Focus on understanding the data first, then implementing improvements over weeks and months.
</Tip>

## Common First-Time Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why didn't my brand appear in some prompts?">
    This is completely normal and can happen for several reasons:

    - **Prompts may be too broad** - Generic queries like "best software" might not mention niche brands
    - **Brand recognition** - Newer or specialized brands may have lower AI awareness
    - **Different naming** - AI might know you by a variation of your brand name
    - **Market positioning** - You might not be top-of-mind for those specific queries

    Try using more specific prompts that target your actual market segment. See [Working with Prompts](/working-with-prompts) for guidance on creating effective queries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often do new reports run?">
    - **Daily automatic reports** run every morning after your initial setup
    - **New prompts** you add are included in the next day's report
    - **Historical data** builds over time, enabling trend analysis
    - **No manual triggering** - reports run on a fixed schedule

    Learn more about report timing in [Reading Reports](/reading-reports).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My scores seem low. Is that bad?">
    Not necessarily! Context matters:

    - **New brands** typically start with lower scores
    - **Niche markets** may have inherently lower visibility
    - **Strong competitors** can suppress scores in crowded markets
    - **Baseline is key** - use your starting scores to measure improvement

    Focus on upward trends over time rather than absolute numbers. See [Understanding Scores](/understanding-scores) for benchmarks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I improve my visibility?">
    Improving AI visibility is a multi-faceted effort:

    - **Content optimization** - Make your site more crawlable and informative
    - **Technical improvements** - Run a [Technical Audit](/technical-audit) to fix issues
    - **Citation building** - Get mentioned in authoritative sources AI models reference
    - **Consistent quality** - Publish expert content that establishes authority

    Consider using [Optimize Content](/optimize-content) to get specific recommendations for improvement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I track multiple brands?">
    Yes! You can add multiple brands to your account:

    - **Free plan**: 1 brand
    - **Growth plan**: 1 brand + additional brands at \$39/month each
    - **Scale plan**: 10 brands included + additional brands at \$39/month each

    See the [Plans page](/plans) for full details on multi-brand tracking.
