## Overview

Connect your Google Analytics 4 (GA4) property to Trakkr to see detailed breakdowns of traffic from AI sources like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. This integration helps you understand how users referred by AI models interact with your site, track conversions, and measure engagement.

### Complete Tracking Suite

Google Analytics integration works alongside Trakkr's other tracking features:

<Tip>
  **Recommended setup**: Use Google Analytics for user traffic tracking + Crawler Analytics for bot monitoring + Prompts for understanding what queries drive visibility.
</Tip>

## Setup

### Connecting Your GA4 Property

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to **Integrations** from your Trakkr dashboard sidebar, then select **Google Analytics**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect with Google">

      style={{ width:"53%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Trakkr will load your analytics data and display your dashboard. This may take a few seconds for high-traffic properties.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Important**: Ensure your Google account has read access to the GA4 property. Without proper permissions, the connection will fail.

## Understanding the Dashboard

![Screenshot2025 11 06at19 42 59 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-11-06at19.42.59.png)

### Summary Metrics

The top of the dashboard shows three key metrics with 30-day trends:

- **Total sessions**: Total AI-referred sessions with average per day
- **Engaged sessions**: Sessions where users actively engaged with your content
- **Session duration**: Average time AI-referred users spend on your site

Each metric includes a visual trend chart to help you spot patterns over time.

### Traffic by AI Source

On the right side, you'll see a breakdown of sessions by AI referrer:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="ChatGPT" icon="comments" color="#0e9373">
    Traffic from OpenAI's ChatGPT
  </Card>
  <Card title="Perplexity" icon="magnifying-glass" color="#0e9373">
    Traffic from Perplexity AI search
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gemini" icon="sparkles" color="#0e9373">
    Traffic from Google's Gemini
  </Card>
  <Card title="Claude" icon="brain" color="#0e9373">
    Traffic from Anthropic's Claude
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grok" icon="robot" color="#0e9373">
    Traffic from xAI's Grok
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Click on any AI model** to filter the entire dashboard and see metrics specific to that source.

### Detailed Traffic Trends

The main chart shows a detailed view of AI traffic over time. This updates based on:

- Your selected date range
- Any AI source filter you've applied by clicking a model name

Use this to identify traffic spikes, patterns, or correlations with your content updates.

## Analyzing Events

![Screenshot2025 11 06at19 43 32 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-11-06at19.43.32.png)

### Event Selection

Below the main traffic chart, you can analyze specific events from your GA4 property:

1. Click the **event selector dropdown** to choose an event
2. Available events include:
   - Standard events: `page_view`, `session_start`, `user_engagement`, `first_visit`, `scroll`
   - Custom events: Any conversion events or custom tracking you've configured in GA4

### AI vs Other Traffic Comparison

Once you select an event, Trakkr shows a comparison table:

| Metric             | AI Traffic                            | Other Traffic                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Count**          | Total events from AI sources          | Total events from all other sources |
| **Value**          | Monetary value (if configured in GA4) | Monetary value from other sources   |
| **Events/Session** | Average events per AI session         | Average events per other sessions   |

This helps you understand whether AI-referred traffic converts differently than organic, paid, or other referral sources.

### Event Trends Chart

Below the comparison table, see a trend chart for your selected event with toggle options:

- **Count**: Volume of events over time
- **Value**: Monetary value of events over time (if configured)

## Settings & Management

### Adjusting the Date Range

Click the **date range selector** in the top-right corner to change the time period:

- Default: Last 30 days
- Custom ranges available
- Data refreshes automatically when you change the range

### Connection Status

If you see a connection error:

<Warning>
  **Connection Failed**: This usually means permissions have changed or been revoked.
</Warning>

To fix:

1. Click **Settings** in the top-right corner
2. Select **Reset Integration**
3. Reconnect with a Google account that has read access to your GA4 property

### Disconnecting

To disconnect your GA4 property:

1. Go to **Settings** (top-right of the analytics dashboard)
2. Click **Reset Integration**
3. Confirm the disconnection

## How It Works

### AI Traffic Detection

Trakkr identifies AI-referred traffic using UTM source parameters. When AI models refer users to your site, they typically include specific UTM parameters in the referral URL. Trakkr automatically:

1. Monitors your GA4 data in real-time
2. Filters for known AI source UTM parameters
3. Aggregates and displays this data in your dashboard

### Data Freshness

- **Refresh frequency**: Data refreshes on each page load
- **GA4 delay**: Google Analytics 4 typically has a 24-48 hour processing delay for some metrics
- **Real-time data**: Session counts reflect near real-time data from GA4

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Track AI Conversion Performance">
    Set up conversion events in GA4 (purchases, sign-ups, downloads), then use the Events section to compare conversion rates between AI traffic and other sources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Identify High-Value AI Sources">
    If certain AI models drive more engaged sessions or longer visit durations, focus your optimization efforts on improving visibility in those specific AI tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validate AI Optimization Efforts">
    After implementing technical audits or content optimizations from Trakkr, use this dashboard to measure whether AI-referred traffic increases over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Report AI Impact to Stakeholders">
    Use the visual charts and comparison tables to show executives or clients how AI search is driving real traffic and conversions to your site.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="GA4 Required" icon="chart-line" color="#0e9373">
    This integration only works with Google Analytics 4. Universal Analytics is not supported.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Read Access" icon="lock-open" color="#0e9373">
    Your Google account must have at least read access to the GA4 property you want to connect.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

If your dashboard is empty after connecting:

1. **Check date range**: Ensure you've selected a period when your site had traffic
2. **Verify AI traffic**: Confirm your site actually receives AI-referred traffic (check UTM sources in GA4 directly)
3. **Allow processing time**: GA4 can take 24-48 hours to process some data

### Connection Keeps Failing

- Ensure you're using a Google account with read access to the property
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Verify the GA4 property ID is correct
- Check if your GA4 account has any restrictions or has been suspended

### Data Doesn't Match GA4

- Trakkr only shows AI-referred traffic (filtered by UTM sources), while GA4 shows all traffic
- GA4 has processing delays; data may take time to appear
- Different date ranges or timezone settings can cause discrepancies
