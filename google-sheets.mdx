## Overview

Google Sheets sync automatically exports your Trakkr data to a Google Sheet each morning, keeping your data fresh without manual exports. Perfect for building custom dashboards, client reports, or collaborative analysis.

### When to Use Google Sheets Sync

Google Sheets sync is ideal for:

- **Daily updates** - Automated data refresh every morning
- **Team collaboration** - Share live data with colleagues without Trakkr access
- **Simple dashboards** - Build charts and reports in familiar spreadsheet tools
- **Client reporting** - Keep client-facing sheets always current
- **No-code analysis** - Use spreadsheet formulas without programming

## How It Works

Once configured, Trakkr syncs your data to Google Sheets automatically:

- **Daily sync**: Every morning after your Trakkr data updates
- **Three tabs**: One for each export format (Top-Level, Detailed, Raw Data)
- **Automatic refresh**: Data overwrites each day to stay current
- **Initial dump**: Immediate sync when you first set up the integration

## Setting Up Google Sheets Sync

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Google Sheet">
    Create a new, empty Google Sheet for your Trakkr data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share with Trakkr">
    Share your sheet (with editor permissions) with:

    [**google-sheets@trakkr-ai.iam.gserviceaccount.com**](mailto:google-sheets@trakkr-ai.iam.gserviceaccount.com)

    This service account needs access to write data to your sheet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Google Sheets integration">
    Go to **Integrations** → **Google Sheets** in Trakkr.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste your sheet URL">
    Copy your Google Sheet URL and paste it into the field. Click **Set up Sync**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for initial sync">
    Trakkr verifies permissions and performs an initial data dump. This takes about 1 minute to complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Trakkr checks that the service account has the correct sharing permissions before setting up the sync. If permissions are incorrect, you'll see an error message.
</Note>

## What Gets Synced

Your Google Sheet will contain three tabs, each with different data views:

### Tab 1: Top-Level

High-level performance metrics over time.

**Columns**:

- Date
- Brand
- Visibility
- Presence

**Best for**: Executive dashboards, trend charts, performance overviews

### Tab 2: Detailed

Prompt-level performance for in-depth analysis.

**Columns**:

- Date
- Prompt
- Tag
- Model
- Rank

**Best for**: Content optimization, prompt analysis, model-specific insights

### Tab 3: Raw Data

Complete competitive intelligence with full rankings.

**Columns**:

- Date
- Prompt
- Tag
- Model
- Rank1 through Rank10

**Best for**: Competitive analysis, market research, comprehensive data projects

## Managing Your Sync

### Viewing Sync Status

Once configured, the Google Sheets integration page shows:

- Your connected sheet URL
- **View Sheet**: Opens your Google Sheet in a new tab
- **Delete Sync**: Disconnects the integration

### Updating Your Sheet

To change which sheet receives data:

1. Click **Delete Sync**
2. Set up a new sync with a different sheet URL

<Warning>
  Deleting the sync stops automatic daily updates. Your Google Sheet will retain existing data, but no new data will be synced.
</Warning>

## Sync Timing

- **Daily sync**: Occurs each morning, immediately after Trakkr updates your data
- **Initial sync**: Runs within 1 minute of setup
- **Data refresh**: Overwrites existing data to ensure accuracy

<Tip>
  The sync happens automatically—no need to manually refresh or trigger updates.
</Tip>

## Permissions & Security

### Required Permissions

The Trakkr service account needs **Editor** access to:

- Write data to your sheet
- Create and update tabs
- Overwrite data during daily syncs

### Data Security

- **Service account**: Uses Google's secure service account authentication
- **Access control**: You control who can view your Google Sheet
- **Data privacy**: Only your Trakkr data is synced—no access to other sheets

<Note>
  The service account only has access to sheets you explicitly share with it. It cannot access any other files in your Google Drive.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Setup Fails

If you see an error during setup:

1. **Verify sharing**: Ensure you shared the sheet with `google-sheets@trakkr-ai.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
2. **Check permissions**: The service account needs **Editor** access, not just Viewer
3. **Confirm URL**: Make sure you copied the full Google Sheet URL
4. **Try again**: Delete the sync attempt and start over

### Data Not Updating

If your data isn't syncing:

1. **Check sync status**: Verify the sync is still active in the integration page
2. **Confirm timing**: Syncs happen in the morning—wait until after your Trakkr data updates
3. **Verify permissions**: Ensure the service account still has access to your sheet
4. **Re-sync**: Delete and recreate the sync if issues persist

### Missing Tabs

If tabs are missing or incorrectly formatted:

- **Delete old tabs**: Remove any manually created tabs with the same names
- **Re-run sync**: Delete the sync and set up again to regenerate tabs
- **Check permissions**: Ensure the service account can edit the sheet

## Tips for Using Synced Data

### Preserve Manual Work

If you add custom charts or formulas to your synced sheet:

- Create a separate tab for analysis—don't modify the synced tabs
- Use formulas that reference the synced tabs (e.g., `='Top-Level'!A:D`)
- This ensures your custom work isn't overwritten during daily syncs

### Combining Data

Use Google Sheets formulas to combine data from multiple tabs:

- **VLOOKUP**: Match data across tabs
- **Pivot tables**: Aggregate data from Raw Data tab
- **Charts**: Visualize trends from Top-Level tab

### Sharing with Stakeholders

When sharing your synced sheet:

- Set appropriate permissions (Viewer vs. Editor)
- Add a note explaining the sync timing
- Create a separate "Dashboard" tab for easy viewing
