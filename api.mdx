## Overview

The Trakkr API allows you to programmatically access your AI visibility data and build custom integrations. Pull data into internal dashboards, trigger automated workflows, or integrate with your existing tech stack.

## Getting Started

### Generate Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to **Integrations** from your sidebar, then select **API**.

    [image]
  </Step>

  <Step title="View your API key">
    Your API key is displayed with the first and last characters visible for security. The middle characters are hidden.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your API key">
    Copy your full API key and use it in your integration. Include it in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure. If you suspect it has been compromised, delete it and generate a new one immediately.
</Warning>

### View Your Brand IDs

The API uses Brand IDs as unique identifiers for each of your brands. You can find these in the Integrations → API page, or retrieve them programmatically via the `/get-brands` endpoint.

## When to Use the API

The API is best suited for:

- **Automated workflows** - Trigger actions based on score changes or new data
- **Custom integrations** - Build Trakkr into your existing tools and platforms
- **Real-time data access** - Pull fresh data programmatically whenever needed
- **Complex data processing** - Apply your own analytics or combine with other data sources
- **High-volume operations** - Batch operations or frequent data pulls

## API Key Management

### Regenerating Your Key

If you need to generate a new API key:

1. Click **Delete Key** in the API integration page
2. Confirm the deletion
3. A new key will be automatically generated
4. Update all integrations using the old key

<Note>
  Deleting your API key will immediately invalidate it. Any integrations using the old key will stop working until you update them with the new key.
</Note>

## Rate Limits

API rate limits are designed to prevent abuse while allowing legitimate use:

- **Standard requests**: 100 requests per minute
- **Bulk data endpoints**: 10 requests per minute

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Contact support if you need higher rate limits for enterprise use cases.
