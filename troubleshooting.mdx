# Troubleshooting

This guide addresses the most common issues you might experience with Trakkr, from zero mentions to technical problems. Most issues can be resolved by understanding how AI brand tracking works and adjusting your approach accordingly.

## Zero Mentions Despite AI Presence

This is the most frequently reported issue. You might say "I know AI mentions my brand, but Trakkr shows zero mentions." Understanding why this happens helps resolve the problem quickly.

### Why This Occurs

**Prompt Specificity Mismatch**
Your prompts may not match the contexts where AI models actually mention your brand. For example, if you're a project management tool but your prompts ask about "business software" generally, AI models might mention you in response to "team collaboration tools" instead.

**Brand Name Variations**
AI models might know your brand by different names or variations. They could mention "Apple Inc." while you're tracking "Apple," or refer to "McDonald's Corporation" when you're monitoring "McDonald's." Similarly, they might use abbreviations, acronyms, or informal names.

**Market Positioning Differences**
Your prompts might target a broader or narrower market than where your brand actually has recognition. If you're a specialized B2B tool but your prompts ask about consumer software, AI models won't make the connection.

**Training Data Limitations**
AI models have training data cutoffs, and newer brands or recent rebranding efforts might not be well-represented. Additionally, some models may have stronger knowledge in certain industries or geographic regions.

### Diagnostic Steps

Start by testing your brand recognition directly. Try asking the AI models simple questions like "What is [YourBrand]?" or "Tell me about [YourBrand]" to see if they know your brand at all. If they don't recognize your brand name, the issue is fundamental brand awareness in AI training data.

Next, examine your prompts for relevance. Look at each prompt and honestly assess whether your brand should appear in the top 10 responses. If you're a niche player in a competitive market, you might need more specific prompts that better reflect your actual market position.

Test alternative brand names by checking if AI models know you by variations, abbreviations, or your full legal name. Sometimes brands are better known by their parent company name or a specific product name.

### Solutions

**Refine Your Prompts**
Make your prompts more specific to your actual market segment. Instead of "best business software," try "best project management tools for remote teams" if that's your specific niche. Use the language your customers actually use when searching for solutions like yours.

**Test Multiple Contexts**
Create prompts covering different aspects of your business. If you're mentioned in response to questions about specific features, use cases, or industry applications, make sure you have prompts covering those areas.

**Check Name Recognition**
If AI models know you by a different name, consider whether you should update your brand name in Trakkr or create content that reinforces your preferred brand name usage.

**Start Broader, Then Narrow**
Begin with prompts where you're confident you should appear, even if they're very specific to your niche. Once you see mentions, gradually expand to broader industry questions.

## Prompt Management Issues

### Prompts Not Running or Infinite Spinners

You might encounter issues with prompts getting stuck or not executing properly. This typically happens during the prompt creation or editing process.

**During Setup**
If your prompts seem stuck during initial setup, wait for the full setup process to complete. The "Running your first report" step can take up to 30 seconds, and interrupting it may cause issues.

**Adding New Prompts**
When you add prompts after initial setup, they won't run immediately. New prompts are included in the next daily report, which means you'll see results the following day. There's no way to trigger immediate execution.

**Editing Existing Prompts**
If you're having trouble saving edits to existing prompts, ensure you're not exceeding character limits or using special characters that might cause formatting issues. Save changes one at a time rather than making multiple edits simultaneously.

### Site Addition Problems

You might experience issues adding your website during setup or when creating new brands. This usually relates to website accessibility or format issues.

**Website Format**
Ensure you're entering the complete URL including "https://" or "http://". Enter "https://yoursite.com" rather than just "yoursite.com."

**Website Accessibility**
Your website needs to be publicly accessible for Trakkr to analyze it. Sites behind login walls, under construction pages, or with strict bot blocking may cause issues.

**Temporary Issues**
If your website is temporarily down or experiencing issues during setup, this can cause the analysis to fail. Try the setup process again when your site is fully accessible.

## Score Fluctuations and Anomalies

### Understanding Normal Variation

Some score fluctuation is completely normal and expected. Different AI models update their training data at different times, so your scores may vary as models incorporate new information. Additionally, AI models can have slight randomness in their responses, meaning the same prompt might generate slightly different results on different days.

Market dynamics also affect scores. New competitors entering the market, existing competitors launching major campaigns, or industry events can influence how AI models rank brands.

### When to Be Concerned

**Sudden Dramatic Drops**
If your visibility or presence scores drop by more than 20 points overnight without obvious cause, investigate which specific prompts or models are affected. This might indicate a change in AI model behavior or new competitive dynamics.

**Consistent Decline Over Weeks**
A steady decline over multiple weeks suggests a real trend rather than random variation. Analyze whether this coincides with competitive launches, market changes, or changes to your own prompts.

**Extreme Scores**
Visibility scores over 100 or presence scores over 100% indicate a calculation error and should be reported to support. Similarly, identical scores across multiple days might suggest a data processing issue.

### Troubleshooting Score Issues

Review your prompt performance individually to identify which specific prompts are causing unusual results. Sometimes one problematic prompt can significantly affect your overall scores.

Check the Query View for affected prompts to see exactly what AI models are returning. This helps you identify whether the issue is with your brand mentions specifically or with the AI models' responses generally.

Compare your performance across different AI models. If only one model shows unusual results, this might indicate model-specific issues rather than problems with your brand or prompts.

## Technical Platform Issues

### Dashboard Loading Problems

If your dashboard isn't loading properly, first check your internet connection and try refreshing the page. Browser cache issues can sometimes cause display problems, so try clearing your browser cache or opening Trakkr in an incognito/private window.

Some browser extensions, particularly ad blockers or privacy tools, can interfere with dashboard functionality. Try disabling extensions temporarily to see if this resolves the issue.

### Report Generation Failures

Daily reports occasionally fail due to temporary API issues with AI models or high system load. If you notice a report didn't generate on a particular day, it should resume automatically the next day. Multiple consecutive days of missing reports indicate a more serious issue that requires support intervention.

### Data Export Issues

If data export isn't working, ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) and that downloads aren't being blocked by your browser settings. Large exports may take several minutes to process, so wait before assuming the export has failed.

## Account and Setup Issues

### Email Verification Problems

If you're not receiving verification emails, check your spam/junk folder as automated emails sometimes get filtered. Also verify you entered your email address correctly during signup.

Some corporate email systems have strict filtering that blocks automated emails. If you're using a company email, try signing up with a personal email address or contact your IT department about allowlisting emails from Trakkr.

### Multiple Brand Setup

While Trakkr supports multiple brands per account, each brand requires separate setup through the same process. You might expect to add multiple brands simultaneously, but each brand needs individual configuration with its own prompts and analysis.

## Prevention Tips

### Setting Realistic Expectations

Remember that AI brand tracking reflects how AI models currently understand your brand based on their training data. If your brand isn't well-known online or in your industry, this will be reflected in your scores.

Your scores naturally fluctuate as AI models update and as market dynamics change. Focus on long-term trends rather than daily variations, and remember that improving AI visibility often takes time and consistent effort.

### Best Practices for Stable Tracking

Start with prompts where you're confident your brand should appear, then gradually expand to more competitive or broader queries. Monitor your prompt performance regularly and refine those that consistently underperform.

Keep detailed notes about changes you make to prompts so you can correlate score changes with specific modifications. This helps you understand what works and what doesn't for your brand.

Maintain consistent tracking by avoiding frequent major changes to your prompt set. While optimization is important, constantly changing prompts makes it difficult for you to identify meaningful trends in your data.
