description: "Your unfair advantage in AI search. Monitor your brand and competitors across all major AI models in real-time."
---

Trakkr gives you **real-time intelligence on who's winning in AI search, and exactly how to beat them**. While your competitors wonder if they're invisible to AI, you'll have live, actionable insights to expose their strategy, grow your visibility, and win new customers.

<Note>
  Think of Trakkr as "SEO for AI" - instead of tracking Google search rankings, we track how AI models rank and mention your brand across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and more.
</Note>

## The Problem We Solve

When users ask ChatGPT "What are the best CRM tools?" or Claude "Which accounting software should I use?", **where does your brand appear?** Most businesses have no idea—until now.

### Your competitors are already tracking their AI visibility. Are you?

- **50+ billion** AI-powered searches happen monthly across major platforms
- **73% of professionals** now use AI tools for research and recommendations
- **AI recommendations** increasingly influence purchasing decisions
- **Traditional SEO metrics** don't capture AI-driven visibility

The stakes are real: if AI models don't mention your brand—or worse, recommend competitors instead—you're losing customers to an invisible channel you can't measure.

## Key Metrics We Track
