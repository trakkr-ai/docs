# Welcome to Trakkr

Trakkr is the first platform designed to track and measure your brand's visibility across AI language models. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into search, recommendations, and decision-making, understanding how your brand appears in AI responses is crucial for modern businesses.

## What is AI Brand Tracking?

When users ask AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini questions about products, services, or companies in your industry, where does your brand appear? Trakkr answers this question by:

- **Querying multiple AI models** with industry-relevant prompts
- **Tracking your brand's ranking** in AI responses
- **Measuring visibility trends** over time
- **Identifying new competitors** mentioned by AI models
- **Providing actionable insights** to improve your AI presence

<Note>
  Think of Trakkr as "SEO for AI" - instead of tracking Google search rankings, we track how AI models rank and mention your brand.
</Note>
