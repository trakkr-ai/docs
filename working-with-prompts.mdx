Prompts are the questions Trakkr asks AI models about your industry. Creating effective prompts is crucial for accurate brand tracking and competitive intelligence. This guide covers everything from writing your first prompt to analyzing performance.

## Creating Your First Prompts

### Step 1: Identify Your Categories

Start by listing the different ways customers might discover your brand:

**By Use Case**

- What problems does your product/service solve?
- What specific tasks or goals do customers have?
- What outcomes are customers trying to achieve?

**By Audience**

- Who are your primary customer segments?
- What industries or company sizes do you serve?
- What user roles typically evaluate your solution?

**By Features/Benefits**

- What are your key differentiators?
- What features do customers care most about?
- What benefits do you provide?

### Step 2: Draft Initial Prompts

Write 5-10 prompts covering different angles:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Broad">
    Begin with general industry questions: "What are the best [category] tools?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Specificity">
    Include target audience: "Best [category] for [specific audience]"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Focus on Use Cases">
    Address specific needs: "Top [category] for [specific use case]"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consider Context">
    Add situational elements: "Leading [category] for [specific context/constraint]"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Test and Refine

After your first report, analyze which prompts work best:

**High-Performing Prompts**

- Consistently mention your brand and relevant competitors
- Generate diverse, relevant responses
- Reflect actual customer decision-making

**Low-Performing Prompts**

- Rarely mention your brand (may be too broad/narrow)
- Generate irrelevant or inconsistent responses
- Don't reflect real customer scenarios

## Understanding Prompt Performance

### Prompt Summary Metrics

Each prompt shows individual performance in your reports:

**Visibility Score per Prompt**

- How well you rank when mentioned for this specific prompt
- Helps identify your strongest positioning areas
- Shows which prompts align best with your brand strength

**Presence Score per Prompt**

- What percentage of AI models mention you for this prompt
- Indicates your "share of voice" for specific topics
- Reveals gaps in brand awareness

### Query View Analysis

The detailed Query View shows exactly how each AI model responded:

**Brand Rankings**

- See your exact position in each AI model's response
- Compare performance across different models
- Identify which models favor your brand

**Competitor Mentions**

- Discover who AI models consider your competition
- See which competitors appear most frequently
- Identify emerging threats or opportunities

**Response Patterns**

- Understand why AI models rank brands in specific orders
- Learn what context or framing generates better results
- Identify language or positioning opportunities

## Prompt Optimization Strategies

### Improving Low-Performing Prompts

**If you're rarely mentioned:**

- **Broaden the prompt** - may be too specific to your niche
- **Change the context** - try different use cases or audiences
- **Check relevance** - ensure the prompt matches your actual market
- **Consider brand awareness** - you may not be known for this specific area

**If you're mentioned but ranked poorly:**

- **Analyze top competitors** - what positioning do they have?
- **Refine targeting** - focus on areas where you're stronger
- **Consider prompt framing** - how the question is asked matters
- **Look for differentiation** - prompts highlighting your unique strengths

### Creating Prompt Variations

Test different versions of similar questions:

**Audience Variations**

- "Best [tool] for startups" vs "Best [tool] for enterprises"
- "Top [service] for small businesses" vs "Leading [service] for large companies"

**Context Variations**

- "Best [product] for beginners" vs "Professional [product] recommendations"
- "Most affordable [solution]" vs "Premium [solution] options"

**Outcome Variations**

- "Tools to increase productivity" vs "Software for team collaboration"
- "Solutions for cost reduction" vs "Platforms for growth"

### Seasonal and Trending Prompts

**Industry Trends**

- Update prompts to reflect current market focus
- Add prompts around emerging technologies or methods
- Consider seasonal business cycles

**Current Events**

- Reference recent industry changes or challenges
- Include prompts about new regulations or standards
- Address evolving customer needs

## Common Prompt Issues

### "My brand never appears"

**Possible causes:**

- Prompts too broad (asking about entire market vs. your segment)
- Brand not well-known in AI training data
- Using different brand name variations
- Targeting wrong audience or use case

**Solutions:**

- Try more specific prompts targeting your actual market
- Test prompts where you know you should appear
- Check if AI models know your brand by variations of your name
- Consider whether your brand has sufficient online presence

### "Inconsistent results across models"

**Why this happens:**

- Different AI models have different training data and cutoff dates
- Models may specialize in different types of knowledge
- Some models favor certain types of brands or companies

**What to do:**

- This is normal - focus on overall trends
- Look for patterns in which models favor your brand
- Don't optimize for just one model

### "Competitors I don't recognize"

**Understanding new competitors:**

- AI models may identify emerging or adjacent competitors
- Brands from related industries may appear in broad prompts
- International competitors might be included
- Consider if these represent real competitive threats

## Report Timing and Updates

### When Reports Run

- **Daily automatic reports** include all active prompts
- **New prompts** are included in the next day's report
- **Edited prompts** use the new version in subsequent reports
- **No manual triggering** - reports run on a fixed daily schedule

### Making Changes

- **Edit prompts anytime** in the Prompts section
- **Changes take effect** in the next daily report
- **Historical data** remains unchanged for past reports
- **Trends update** as new data comes in with modified prompts

<Tip>
  Start with broader prompts to understand your competitive landscape, then add more specific prompts to target particular market segments or use cases.
