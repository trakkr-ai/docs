Prompts are the questions Trakkr asks AI models about your industry. Strong prompts reflect real user questions and produce consistent brand/competitor mentions. This guide shows how to write, manage, and interpret prompts—plus how to tag them for aggregate reporting.

## What Makes a Good Prompt

**Natural questions**

- Mirror how customers actually ask
- Use audience language
- Reflect real decision scenarios

**Appropriate scope**

- Broad enough for multiple brands
- Specific enough to stay relevant
- Consistently yields ~5–10 relevant results

**Industry-relevant**

- Matches your market/category
- Covers features, use cases, audiences
- Aligns with how customers discover/evaluate solutions

## Creating Your First Prompts

**Step 1: Identify your categories**

- _By use case_: problems solved, tasks/goals, desired outcomes
- _By audience_: segments, industries/company sizes, evaluator roles
- _By features/benefits_: differentiators, most-valued features, benefits

**Step 2: Draft initial prompts (5–10)**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start broad">
    "What are the best [category] tools?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add specificity">
    "Best [category] for [audience]"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Focus on use cases">
    "Top [category] for [use case]"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Consider context">
    "Leading [category] for [context/constraint]"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Step 3: Test & refine**

- _High-performing_: mention you \+ relevant competitors; diverse, relevant answers; mirrors real decisions
- _Low-performing_: too broad/narrow; inconsistent/irrelevant; not customer-true

## Managing Your Prompts

**Add new prompts**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Prompts">
    Open the Prompts section in your dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Add new prompt'">
    Use the green button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your prompt">
    Enter a natural-language question
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save & activate">
    New prompts auto-enable and run in the next daily report
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Edit existing prompts**

- Edit prompt text
- Enable/disable with toggles
- Monitor individual performance in **Prompt Summary**
- Delete underperformers

<Warning>
  Changes appear in the next daily report. You cannot trigger reports immediately.
</Warning>

**Prompt capacity & limits**

- Most accounts can add multiple prompts (limits vary by plan, but is up to 50)
- Contact [mack@trakkr.ai](mailto:mack@trakkr.ai) to increase limits if needed

**Best practices**

- Start with 5–10 high-quality prompts
- Remove consistent underperformers
- Focus on prompts that yield actionable competitive intelligence

## Understanding Prompt Performance

**Prompt Summary metrics**

- _Visibility Score per Prompt_: how well you rank when mentioned; shows strongest positioning; aligns prompts to brand strength
- _Presence Score per Prompt_: % of models that mention you; your share of voice; reveals awareness gaps

**Query View analysis**

- _Brand rankings_: exact position per model; cross-model comparison; see which models favor you
- _Competitor mentions_: who models consider competitors; frequency; emerging threats/opportunities
- _Response patterns_: why ordering happens; context/framing that helps; language/positioning opportunities

## Prompt Optimization Strategies

**Improve low-performers**

_If rarely mentioned:_

- Broaden prompt
- Change context (use cases/audiences)
- Check market relevance
- Consider brand awareness for that area

_If mentioned but ranked poorly:_

- Analyze top competitors’ positioning
- Refine targeting to strengths
- Adjust framing
- Highlight differentiation

**Create prompt variations**

- _Audience_: "Best [tool] for startups" vs "…for enterprises"
- _Context_: "Best [product] for beginners" vs "Professional [product] recommendations"
- _Outcome_: "Increase productivity" vs "Team collaboration"; "Cost reduction" vs "Growth"

**Seasonal & trending prompts**

- _Industry trends_: update for current focus; add emerging tech/methods; reflect seasonality
- _Current events_: new regulations/standards; industry changes; evolving needs

## Common Prompt Issues

**"My brand never appears"**

- _Causes_: too broad; weak training-data awareness; name variations; wrong audience/use case
- _Fixes_: get specific to your market; test known-fit prompts; check brand-name variants; assess online presence

**"Inconsistent results across models"**

- _Why_: different training data & cutoffs; specialization; brand/model biases
- _Do_: treat as normal; focus on trends; don’t over-optimize for one model

**"Competitors I don't recognize"**

- Emerging/adjacent brands; related industries; international players—evaluate if truly competitive

## Report Timing & Updates

**When reports run**

- Daily automatic reports include all active prompts
- New prompts appear next day
- Edited prompts use the new text in subsequent reports
- No manual triggering (fixed daily schedule)

**Making changes**

- Edit anytime in Prompts
- Changes take effect in the next daily report
- Historical data stays unchanged
- Trends update as new data arrives

<Tip>
  Start broad to map the landscape, then layer specific prompts for segments and use cases.
</Tip>

## Prompt Tags

Prompt tags let you **group related prompts** (e.g., by product line, service, campaign, or market) so you can **measure performance at an aggregate level**—not just per prompt. This is especially valuable when a single brand spans **multiple products or services**, because you can view how each area performs across all the questions you track.

You **create and manage tags** on the [Prompts](https://trakkr.ai/prompts) page. Tags can be **assigned to prompts one at a time** when you’re editing individual rows, or **applied in bulk** to speed up large updates.

Once tags are in place, the **Tags section** of your dashboard shows **visibility aggregated by tag**, giving you a clean, high-level read on how a product or theme is performing. You can also **filter your Prompts table by tag** to focus the view on a specific product, service, or initiative—making day-to-day analysis faster.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create tags on the Prompts page">
    Open the [Prompts](https://trakkr.ai/prompts) page, create tags you’ll use for grouping (e.g., “Enterprise”, “Payments”, “EU Market”). You can do this in each prompt row, or by using Manage Tags.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign tags to prompts">
    Apply tags manually (one at a time) while editing, or use bulk assignment to update many prompts at once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze by tag">
    Use the Tags section to see aggregate visibility and filter the Prompts table by tag for easier viewing.
  </Step>
</Steps>
