Teams enables seamless collaboration by allowing you to share your Trakkr account with colleagues. All team members get access to the same brands, reports, and data - perfect for agencies, marketing teams, and organizations tracking multiple brands together.

## How Teams Work

When you create a team, you become the **Owner** - maintaining control over billing and critical account functions. You can then invite unlimited team members as either **Admins** (who can manage everything except billing) or **Viewers** (who have read-only access).

All team members share the same brand list, ensuring everyone works with consistent, synchronized data.

## Setting Up Your Team

### Create Your Team

Navigate to [**My Account**](https://trakkr.ai/account) → **Team** tab to get started.

**Steps:**

1. **Name Your Team** - Enter a team name that represents your organization or group
2. **Automatic Setup** - You become the team Owner with full control over billing and team management
3. **Start Inviting** - Add team members immediately - there's no limit on Scale plans

### Invite Team Members

Owners and Admins can invite new members from the Team page.

**Steps:**

1. **Enter Email** - Add the email address of your colleague
2. **Choose Role** - Select Admin for full management access, or Viewer for read-only access
3. **Send Invite** - They'll receive an email with a secure link to join your team

> **Info:** Invitations expire after 7 days. You can resend or cancel pending invites anytime.

## Joining a Team

### For New Users

If you don't have a Trakkr account yet:

1. Click the invitation link in your email
2. Create your account with the invited email address
3. You'll automatically join the team with access to all shared brands

### For Existing Users

> **Warning:** Joining a team replaces your individual brand list with the team's shared brands. Your personal brands won't be deleted but will no longer be accessible while you're part of a team.

1. Click the invitation link in your email
2. Review the team you're joining
3. Accept to sync with the team's brand list

## Managing Your Team

### Team Overview

The Team page displays:

- **Active members** with their roles and join dates
- **Pending invitations** waiting for acceptance
- **Quick actions** to manage members (Owner only)

### Member Management

**For Owners:**

- Change any member's role between Admin and Viewer
- Remove members who immediately lose access
- Cancel pending invitations

**For Admins:**

- Invite new Viewers (cannot invite other Admins)
- View team roster and activity

### Brand Synchronization

All team members work with the same synchronized brand list:

- When the Owner adds a brand, it appears for everyone
- Brand selections are individual - each member can work on different brands
- Changes to brand settings affect all team members instantly

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

Grant Admin access only to those who need to manage brands and settings. Use Viewer role for stakeholders who need visibility but not control.

### Onboarding

Add context when inviting members - let them know which brands they'll be working with and their expected responsibilities.

### Access Control

Regularly review your team roster. Remove members who no longer need access to maintain security.

### Communication

Coordinate brand management changes with your team to avoid conflicts when multiple Admins work simultaneously.

## Limitations

- **Owner role cannot be transferred** - the account creator remains the Owner
- **One team per user** - you cannot be part of multiple teams simultaneously
- **Scale plan required** - Teams feature is not available on Starter or Growth plans
