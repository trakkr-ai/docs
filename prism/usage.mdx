All upgraded Trakkr accounts allow you to access Prism, and include 10,000 crawler requests per calendar month. This should be sufficient for all small sites and many medium-sized sites.

If you own a larger site that's receiving more than 10,000 crawler requests per month, you can enable overage billing. This is billed at \$5 per additional thousand crawler requests, and is added onto your subscription at the end of each calendar month.

To enable overage billing, you must also set a spend cap. This spend cap increases your limit from the base 10,000 crawler requests per month. So for example, if your spend cap is \$100, your new request limit will be 30,000 crawler requests per month. This is because you get 10,000 requests for free, and $100/\$5 gives 20, or an extra 20,000 requests (10,000 \+ 20,000 = 30,000 total request limit).
