<Note>
  **Limited Beta** - We're accepting a small number of sites to ensure quality support for each participant.
</Note>

Trakkr Prism is a glimpse at what the future of websites will look like.

It allows sites to serve hyper-structured, machine-friendly versions of your sites to AI crawlers. This makes your site more intelligible to them, helping them understand your brand, and cite it in AI conversations.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Interception">
    Prism operates at the edge, intercepting requests to your DNS/domain
  </Step>
  <Step title="Crawler Detection">
    Identifies requests from known AI crawlers (GPTBot, Claude-Web, ChatGPT, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Content Optimization">
    Serves modified HTML optimized for AI understanding
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Options

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    Inject hyper-relevant, dynamically generated JSON schema into your webpage. This structured data helps AI systems understand your content's context, relationships, and meaning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="HTML Rewriter" icon="file-code" color="#0d9373">
    Return a semantically identical but restructured version of your webpage to crawlers, following AI visibility best practices, in order to improve crawler understanding

## Beta Risks & Considerations

<Warning>
  This is beta software with inherent risks to your site's visibility. Please review all considerations carefully.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Performance Impact" icon="gauge">
    While designed to be minimal, edge processing adds 5-50ms latency to crawler requests. We'll monitor this closely with you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Schema Accuracy" icon="brain">
    AI-generated schemas may occasionally misinterpret content. Beta participants help us refine these models.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Crawler Detection" icon="robot">
    Our crawler identification patterns are continuously updated, but new crawlers may be missed initially.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Your Site's Visibility" icon="flask">
    Trakkr Prism is a first-of-its-kind system, and comes with inherent risks to your site's visibility for all crawlers, be it AI or traditional SEO crawlers. Prism aims to mitigate any risk to traditional SEO visibility by serving semantically identical content, but risks here must be acknowledge upon joining the beta.
