## What Trakkr Does

Think of Trakkr as "SEO for AI" - instead of tracking Google rankings, we track how 6 leading AI models rank your brand:

- **OpenAI** (ChatGPT) - Most widely used AI platform
- **Anthropic** (Claude) - Popular in enterprise applications
- **Google Gemini** - Integrated across Google services
- **xAI Grok** - Real-time information access
- **DeepSeek** - Advanced reasoning capabilities
- **Meta Llama** - Open-source models

## Key Metrics

**Visibility Score (0-100)**\

**Presence Score (0-100%)**\
