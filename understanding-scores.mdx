Trakkr measures your brand's performance across AI models using two key metrics: **Visibility Score** and **Presence Score**. This guide explains how these scores work, how we track your brand, and what your competitive landscape means.

## Visibility Score

Your Visibility Score measures **how prominently** your brand appears when AI models mention you. It ranges from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better positioning.

### How Visibility is Calculated

<Steps>
  <Step title="Position Scoring">
    Each mention gets points based on ranking position:

    - **1st place**: 10 points
    - **2nd place**: 9 points
    - **3rd place**: 8 points
    - **10th place**: 1 point
    - **Not mentioned**: 0 points
  </Step>
  <Step title="Aggregate Across Models">
    We sum points from all AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Meta) for each prompt
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calculate Percentage">
    Your total points ÷ maximum possible points × 100 = raw visibility percentage
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Scaling">
    We apply a square root scaling to make score differences more meaningful and prevent artificial inflation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Visibility Score Examples

**Score 90-100**: Exceptional performance

- Consistently ranked #1-2 across most AI models
- Strong brand recognition in your industry

**Score 70-89**: Strong performance

- Usually in top 3-5 positions when mentioned
- Good brand awareness with room for improvement

**Score 50-69**: Moderate performance

- Mixed rankings, often in positions 5-8
- Indicates opportunities for optimization

**Score 0-49**: Needs improvement

- Low rankings when mentioned, or infrequent mentions
- Consider prompt strategy and brand positioning

<Note>
  A visibility score of 88.1 (like Nike's example) means when AI models mention Nike, they typically rank it very highly - usually in the top 2-3 positions.
</Note>

## Presence Score

Your Presence Score shows **what percentage** of AI queries mention your brand at all. This represents your "share of voice" in AI conversations about your industry.

### How Presence is Calculated

Presence Score = (Number of AI responses mentioning your brand ÷ Total AI responses) × 100

**Example**: If you run 5 prompts across 6 AI models (30 total queries) and your brand appears in 25 responses:

- Presence Score = (25 ÷ 30) × 100 = 83.3%

### Presence Score Interpretation

**80-100%**: Dominant presence

- AI models consistently think of your brand for industry queries
- Strong market awareness and top-of-mind positioning

**60-79%**: Good presence

- Regularly mentioned but some gaps in coverage
- Solid brand recognition with growth opportunities

**40-59%**: Moderate presence

- Inconsistent mentions across different queries
- Brand awareness varies by context

**0-39%**: Limited presence

- Rarely mentioned by AI models
- Indicates low brand awareness or need for different prompts

## How AI Brand Tracking Works

Understanding how we collect and analyze data helps interpret your scores:

### 1. Multi-Model Querying

We track your brand across 6 leading AI platforms:

### 2. Daily Report Generation

- **Automated daily reports** query all AI models with your prompts
- **Each prompt** is sent to all 6 AI models independently
- **Results are analyzed** within 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- **Scores are calculated** and historical trends updated

### 3. Name Mapping & Competitor Detection

**Smart Name Recognition**

- AI models might mention your brand using variations ("Apple Inc." vs "Apple")
- We use AI to map different mentions to your canonical brand name
- Handles typos, abbreviations, and alternate names

**Automatic Competitor Discovery**

- Brands mentioned alongside yours are identified as potential competitors
- Must appear in **2\+ reports** to be added to your competitor list
- Helps you discover emerging competitors you might not know about

### 4. Scoring Methodology

**Why We Use Scaling**

- Raw percentage scores can be misleading (small differences appear huge)
- Square root scaling makes meaningful differences more apparent
- Prevents artificial score inflation while maintaining accuracy
- Scores are capped at 100 to maintain the 0-100 scale

## Understanding Your Competitive Landscape

### Competitor Analysis

The Competitors section shows other brands AI models mention when discussing your industry:

**Competitor Presence Scores**

- Shows how often each competitor appears compared to you
- Higher percentages indicate stronger AI "share of voice"
- Helps identify market leaders and emerging threats

**Competitor Rankings**

- While we don't show competitor visibility scores, you can see their presence
- Use this to understand the competitive landscape
- Identify brands that might not be on your radar

### Market Position Insights

**Dominant Position**: High visibility \+ High presence

- You're a market leader in AI conversations
- Consistently mentioned and highly ranked

**Niche Leader**: High visibility \+ Lower presence

- Strong position in specific contexts
- Opportunity to expand into broader industry conversations

**Emerging Player**: Lower visibility \+ Higher presence

- Frequently mentioned but not prominently positioned
- Focus on improving ranking and brand strength

**Specialist**: Variable scores across different prompts

- Strong in some areas, weak in others
- Tailor strategy to strengthen weak areas

## Factors That Influence Your Scores

### Content & Online Presence

- **Quality content** that establishes authority and expertise
- **Industry recognition** through awards, press, partnerships
- **SEO optimization** helps AI models understand your positioning
- **Active social media** and thought leadership

### Brand Recognition

- **Market maturity** - established brands typically score higher
- **Industry category** - some sectors have more AI awareness
- **Geographic presence** - global brands often outperform local ones
- **Marketing investment** in brand awareness campaigns

### Prompt Strategy

- **Relevant prompts** that match your target market
- **Balanced specificity** - not too broad, not too narrow
- **Multiple contexts** to capture different use cases
- **Regular updates** to reflect market changes

<Tip>
  Scores naturally fluctuate as AI models update their training data and as the competitive landscape evolves. Focus on long-term trends rather than daily variations.
