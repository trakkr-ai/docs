# Welcome to Trakkr API

Trakkr helps you monitor your brand's visibility and presence across different AI models and prompts. Our API provides historical data to track how your brand performs over time in AI-generated content.

## What is Trakkr?

Trakkr analyzes AI model outputs to track brand mentions, rankings, and visibility. We help you understand:

- **Brand Visibility**: How often your brand appears in AI-generated content
- **Brand Presence**: The quality and context of your brand mentions
- **Model Performance**: How different AI models handle your brand
- **Prompt Analysis**: Which prompts lead to better brand representation

## Data Format

All requests and responses use JSON format with UTF-8 encoding. Dates are formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings.
