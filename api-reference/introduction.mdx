<Info>
  Please note that the API is currently in development. It features the main endpoint for getting historical scores, and will have more endpoints added in future to cover Trakkr's additional features.
</Info>

Trakkr helps you monitor your brand's visibility and presence across different AI models and prompts. Our API provides historical data to track how your brand performs over time in AI-generated content.

## Quick Start

1. **Get your API key** from [trakkr.ai/api](https://trakkr.ai/api)
2. **Try the interactive playground** to test endpoints directly in the documentation
3. **Make your first request** to get historical scores
4. **Explore breakdowns** to understand your data better

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trakkr.ai/get-scores \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "brand": "0000000000000x000000000000000000",
    "breakdown": ["model"],
    "start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "end_date": "2024-01-31"
  }'
```


```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.trakkr.ai/get-scores', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    brand: '0000000000000x000000000000000000',
    breakdown: ['model'],
    start_date: '2024-01-01',
    end_date: '2024-01-31'
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
```


```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.trakkr.ai/get-scores',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        'brand': '0000000000000x000000000000000000',
        'breakdown': ['model'],
        'start_date': '2024-01-01',
        'end_date': '2024-01-31'
    }
)

data = response.json()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.trakkr.ai
```

## Data Format

All requests and responses use JSON format with UTF-8 encoding. Dates are formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings.

## Rate Limits

The API is designed to handle your monitoring needs efficiently. For optimal performance, we recommend reasonable request patterns and utilize the built-in caching for frequently accessed data.
