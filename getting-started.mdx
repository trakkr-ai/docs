Trakkr is designed to measure and improve your brand's visibility within AI language models. As AI becomes central to search and product recommendations, understanding how your brand is represented is crucial.

Think of it as "SEO for AI." Instead of tracking Google search rankings, we track how often and how prominently AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude mention your brand in response to user prompts. This allows you to:

- Discover blind spots where competitors are outranking you.
- Track your brand's "share of voice" in the AI ecosystem.
- Measure the impact of your marketing efforts on AI visibility.
- Identify emerging competitors that AI models favor.

## How Trakkr Works: The Core Concepts

The main challenge in AI visibility is that measurement is tough. To solve this, Trakkr is built on a foundation of consistent, repeatable measurement.

### 1. Prompts as a Proxy for Visibility

We start with a set of prompts that your potential customers are likely to ask. These aren't every possible question, but they act as a stable benchmark. If your visibility changes for these prompts, it's a strong signal that your brand's standing within the AI models themselves has changed.

### 2. Daily Reports

Every day, Trakkr sends all of your selected prompts to the major AI models (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.). The collective results of these queries form a **Report**. You can see the raw data from every report on your [Reports page](https://trakkr.ai/reports).

### 3. Key Metrics

From this data, we calculate two main scores:

- [**Visibility Score:**](https://learn.trakkr.ai/understanding-scores#visibility-score) A score from 0-100 that measures how _prominently_ your brand is featured. It considers not just if you were mentioned, but how high up in the list you appeared.
- [**Presence Score:**](https://learn.trakkr.ai/understanding-scores#presence-score-interpretation) A percentage showing how _often_ your brand appears in responses. If you have 5 prompts across 6 models (30 total opportunities) and get mentioned 12 times, your presence score is 40%.

## Frequently Asked Questions

We've run the numbers on support questions, and these are the ones that get asked the most\!

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are my visibiltiy and presence both zero?">
    If both your visibility and presence scores are zero, it means that for the specific set of prompts Trakkr is using to monitor your brand, your brand was not mentioned in any of the responses from the AI models we track. \
    \
    This could be because the AI models do not currently associate your brand with the topics covered in the prompts. It's a strong indicator that there is an opportunity to improve your brand's visibility within these AI systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trakkr says I have visibility zero, but ChatGPT mentions me...">
    ChatGPT and other model UIs can be heavily influenced by context, and what the model knows about you. Mentioning your brand in conversation with ChatGPT at any point can bias it towards mentioning your brand in responses it gives you.

    Trakkr works by interacting with the raw model APIs; stripping out any bias from your past conversations. This provides the truest possible view of model visibility, and will accurately reflect what your customers see in their conversations.
