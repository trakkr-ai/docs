</Note>

## Why Technical Optimization Matters

When AI models crawl your website, they're looking for clear signals about what your content means, how it's structured, and whether it's trustworthy. Technical issues create blind spots—AI models might:

- Miss important pages due to crawlability issues
- Misunderstand your content without proper structured data
- Struggle to extract key information from poorly formatted content
- Deprioritize your site due to accessibility or rendering problems

Technical Audit finds these issues and provides specific, implementable fixes tailored to your CMS and site structure. Making these improvements helps AI models better understand your brand, which can positively influence your visibility and presence scores.

## Getting Started

Click "See X recommended actions" to view all recommendations in the Actions tab.

## Actions Tab

The Actions tab shows prioritized recommendations for improving your site's AI visibility. Each action is ranked by impact, effort, and overall priority to help you focus on what matters most.

![Screenshot2025 11 06at19 33 12 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-11-06at19.33.12.png)

### Understanding Action Attributes

Each recommendation shows several key details to help you decide what to work on:

| Attribute         | Description                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact**        | How much this change will improve AI understanding (High/Low) |
| **Effort**        | How difficult this is to implement (High/Low)                 |
| **Priority**      | Overall importance ranking (1-10 scale)                       |
| **Confidence**    | How certain we are this applies to your site (percentage)     |
| **Affected URLs** | Which pages have this issue                                   |

<Tip>
  Focus first on High Impact + Low Effort actions—these are your "quick wins" that deliver meaningful improvements without major development work.
</Tip>

### Viewing Action Details

Click on any action to expand and see complete implementation guidance:

![Screenshot2025 11 06at19 34 05 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-11-06at19.34.05.png)

**Why it matters**

Explains the business value and how AI models currently struggle with this issue on your site.

**What it'll do**

The specific improvements you'll see after implementing this fix.

**Risks**

Potential downsides or considerations to be aware of (shown when applicable).

**Implementation steps**

Detailed, step-by-step instructions customized for your CMS and technical environment. Trakkr automatically detects your CMS (WordPress, Webflow, custom, etc.) and provides relevant instructions—whether that's installing a plugin, adjusting Webflow settings, or custom code.

### Collaborating with Developers

If you're not implementing the fixes yourself, you can easily delegate:

1. Click "Email instructions" on any action
2. Enter your developer's email address
3. They'll receive a link with the full action details and implementation steps

<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-11-06at19.34.14.png"
  alt="Screenshot2025 11 06at19 34 14 Pn"
  title="Screenshot2025 11 06at19 34 14 Pn"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"74%" }}
/>

This lets non-technical team members audit the site and coordinate fixes without needing to understand the technical details.

### Managing Actions

**Mark as complete**

Once you've implemented a fix, click "Mark as complete." This removes the action from your list and teaches Trakkr not to flag this issue again on future scans.

**Dismiss**

If you've decided not to implement a particular action, click "Dismiss" in the top right. Trakkr will learn your preference and won't show this recommendation on future scans.

## Technical Tab

The Technical tab provides detailed diagnostic information organized by severity and category. This is where you can drill into specific checks and understand exactly what's passing, what needs attention, and what's critical.

![Screenshot2025 11 06at19 33 31 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-11-06at19.33.31.png)

### Issue Severity Levels

Issues are grouped by how urgently they need attention:

**Critical Issues**

Problems that significantly harm AI crawler understanding. These create major blind spots and should be addressed as soon as possible.

**Warnings**

Issues that should be addressed but aren't completely blocking AI understanding. These represent opportunities for improvement.

**Passing**

Checks that passed successfully—areas where your site is already optimized for AI models.

### Exploring by Category

The Technical tab shows all five main categories with pass/fail counts:

- Discoverability & Crawlability
- Accessibility & Rendering
- Content Quality
- Structured Data & Semantics
- Answer-Friendly Formatting

Click on any category to expand and see individual checks within it.

![Screenshot2025 11 06at19 35 02 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-11-06at19.35.02.png)

### Understanding Individual Checks

Each expanded check shows:

- **Check name**: What's being tested (e.g., "Canonical Tags", "Meta Robots Configuration")
- **Status icon**: ✓ Pass, ⚠ Warning, or ✗ Critical
- **Impact level**: High/Medium/Low—how much this affects AI visibility
- **Description**: What this check means and why it matters
- **URLs checked**: Which pages were tested for this issue
- **Details**: Specific findings and context

The Technical tab is useful for:

- Understanding the technical foundation behind your actions

## Strategic Use of Technical Audit

### For Non-Technical Teams

You don't need to be a developer to use Technical Audit effectively:

1. **Run the audit** on your key pages (homepage, top landing pages, product pages)
2. **Review the Overview** to understand high-level issues
3. **Check the Actions tab** for prioritized recommendations
4. **Email instructions** to your development team with specific actions
5. **Track completion** by marking actions as complete once implemented

### For Technical Teams

Use Technical Audit as a diagnostic and prioritization tool:

1. **Run full site scans** to identify systemic issues
2. **Use the Technical tab** to understand root causes
3. **Implement fixes** following the detailed implementation steps
4. **Verify with follow-up audits** after deployment
5. **Monitor trends** as you make ongoing improvements

### Integration with Content Strategy

Technical Audit works best alongside content optimization:

- Fix technical barriers first so AI models can properly access your content
- Use recommendations to improve content formatting (headings, lists, structure)
- Implement structured data to help AI models understand your content meaning
- Create answer-friendly formats that AI models prefer to cite

<Tip>
  Pair Technical Audit with [Content Optimization](/optimize-content) for comprehensive AI visibility improvement—technical fixes ensure accessibility, content optimization ensures relevance.
</Tip>

## Common Audit Issues and Fixes

### Discoverability Issues

**Problem**: AI crawlers can't find or access your content

**Common causes**:

- Missing or misconfigured robots.txt
- No XML sitemap
- Broken canonical tags
- 4xx/5xx HTTP errors

**Impact**: AI models never see your content, eliminating any chance of visibility

### Structured Data Gaps

**Problem**: Your content lacks semantic signals for AI understanding

**Common causes**:

- No schema markup
- Missing meta tags
- Incomplete Article or Product structured data

**Impact**: AI models understand your content less accurately, may misclassify it or extract wrong information

### Content Formatting Issues

**Problem**: Content isn't organized in AI-friendly formats

**Common causes**:

- Missing or generic H1 tags
- No clear heading hierarchy
- Dense paragraphs without lists or structure
- Missing FAQ formats

**Impact**: AI models struggle to extract key points and answers, reducing likelihood of citations

### Rendering Problems

**Problem**: AI crawlers can't properly render your page

**Common causes**:

- JavaScript-only rendering
- Slow page speed
- Mobile rendering issues
- Critical resources blocked

**Impact**: AI models see incomplete or broken content, hurting comprehension and trust

## Best Practices

**Start with single-page audits on your most important pages**

Your homepage and top landing pages drive the most visibility. Fix issues here first for maximum impact.

**Focus on Critical and High Impact issues first**

Not all issues are equally important. Prioritize based on severity and impact rather than trying to fix everything at once.

**Implement fixes in batches**

Group related fixes together (e.g., all structured data improvements) for efficient implementation and testing.

**Run follow-up audits after major changes**

Verify your fixes worked and catch any unintended side effects before moving on to the next batch.

**Use the Technical tab for troubleshooting**

If an Action recommendation isn't clear, check the Technical tab for detailed diagnostics and specific findings.

**Save developer time with specific instructions**

Instead of generic "fix our SEO" requests, email specific Action instructions that developers can implement immediately.

**Consider both AI and traditional SEO**

Many Technical Audit recommendations benefit both AI visibility and traditional search rankings—you're improving both simultaneously.

## Understanding CMS-Specific Recommendations

Trakkr automatically detects your CMS by analyzing your page HTML and provides tailored implementation instructions:

**WordPress**: Plugin recommendations, settings locations, code snippets for functions.php or child themes

**Webflow**: Specific UI locations, custom code placement, collection settings

**Shopify**: Theme customizations, app recommendations, liquid template edits

**Custom builds**: Clean code examples, framework-specific implementations, general best practices

This means you get actionable instructions regardless of your technical environment—no translation required.
