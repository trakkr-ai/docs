</Warning>

Sentiment analysis gives you unprecedented insight into how AI models actually perceive your brand compared to competitors. While other metrics show you mentions and rankings, sentiment analysis reveals the deeper emotional and qualitative associations AI models have with your brand across critical dimensions like trust, quality, innovation, and industry-specific attributes you define.

This feature runs automatically each morning alongside your regular reports, analyzing how AI models rate your brand and competitors on a comprehensive set of sentiment dimensions.

## Setting Up Sentiment Tracking

Before you can start tracking sentiment, you'll need to configure your competitors and define any custom sentiment dimensions specific to your industry.

### Step 1: Select Your Competitors

Choose up to 5 competitors that you want to compare against in sentiment analysis. These should be brands that operate in similar spaces or compete for the same customers.

**What to consider when selecting competitors:**

- **Direct competitors**: Brands offering similar products/services
- **Aspirational targets**: Market leaders you want to benchmark against
- **Emerging players**: Up-and-coming brands that might be gaining ground
- **Category leaders**: Established brands that define your industry

### Step 2: Define Custom Sentiments

Beyond our standard sentiment categories, you can track up to 5 custom sentiment dimensions that are specific to your industry or business priorities.

**Examples of effective custom sentiments:**

- **SaaS companies**: "User interface quality", "Integration capabilities", "Onboarding experience"
- **E-commerce brands**: "Shipping reliability", "Product variety", "Customer service responsiveness"
- **Financial services**: "Security perception", "Regulatory compliance", "Fee transparency"
- **Healthcare**: "Patient care quality", "Technology adoption", "Treatment effectiveness"

**Best practices for custom sentiments:**

- Use **abstract nouns** rather than specific features (e.g., "delivery speed" vs "same-day shipping")
- Focus on **perception-based attributes** rather than factual specifications
- Choose sentiments that **differentiate** your competitive landscape
- Avoid overly **technical jargon** that AI models might not understand consistently

### Step 3: Enable Tracking

Once you've configured your competitors and custom sentiments, enable daily sentiment tracking. The system will begin collecting data the next morning and continue automatically with your regular reports.

<Note>
  Changing competitors or custom sentiments after enabling tracking will affect historical comparisons. Plan your configuration carefully before starting.
</Note>

## How Sentiment Tracking Works

### Daily Analysis Process

Each morning, sentiment tracking runs automatically alongside your regular reports. The system analyzes how AI models perceive your brand and competitors across multiple sentiment dimensions.

**The process:**

1. **Query Generation**: AI models are prompted to evaluate each brand across all sentiment dimensions
2. **Multi-Model Analysis**: Multiple AI platforms provide independent assessments for reliability
3. **Score Calculation**: Each brand receives scores from 1-10 on every sentiment dimension
4. **Data Validation**: Results are validated and standardized for consistency
5. **Dashboard Updates**: Your sentiment dashboard reflects the latest perceptions

### Sentiment Categories

We track sentiment across **five core categories**, each containing multiple specific dimensions:

**Trust & Reliability**

- Overall trust, reliability score, transparency level, safety perception

**Quality & Performance**

- Overall quality, problem resolution, responsiveness, user satisfaction

**Value & Experience**

- Value for money, ease of interaction, accessibility, necessity level

**Market Position**

- Brand recognition, professional image, recommendation likelihood, uniqueness

**Innovation & Appeal**

- Forward thinking, adaptability, likability, confidence inspiring

### Scoring Methodology

**Score Range**: All sentiments are rated on a 1-10 scale

- **9-10**: Exceptional perception
- **7-8**: Strong positive perception
- **5-6**: Neutral/mixed perception
- **3-4**: Below average perception
- **1-2**: Poor perception

**No Weighting**: All sentiment dimensions are treated equally - no single factor is more important than others in our calculations.

**Custom Sentiments**: Your industry-specific sentiments use the same 1-10 scale and are tracked with equal weight alongside standard categories.

## Understanding Your Sentiment Dashboard

### Primary Brand Overview

The main chart shows your brand's overall sentiment score over time, calculated as the average across all standard sentiment dimensions.

**What you're seeing**: A line chart tracking your daily average sentiment score.

**What it means**: Rising trends indicate improving brand perception across AI models. Declining trends suggest potential reputation issues or competitive pressure.

**Why it matters**: This is your brand's "emotional temperature" in AI conversations. Consistent scores above 7.0 indicate strong positive perception.

### Sentiment by Category

The radar chart (pentagon) breaks down your performance across the five core sentiment categories compared to competitors.

**What you're seeing**: Each point on the pentagon represents your average score in that category. The larger the shape, the stronger your overall sentiment profile.

**What it means**:

- **Balanced shape**: Strong across all categories
- **Spiky shape**: Exceptional in some areas, weaker in others
- **Small shape**: Generally weaker sentiment compared to competitors

**Why it matters**: Identifies your sentiment strengths and weaknesses. Use this to understand which aspects of your brand perception need attention.

### Performance by Sentiment

Compare how you and competitors perform across individual sentiment dimensions.

**What you're seeing**: Bar charts showing scores for each sentiment, with your brand highlighted.

**What it means**: Direct head-to-head comparison on specific perception attributes. Higher bars indicate stronger performance in that sentiment.

**Why it matters**: Pinpoints exactly where you're winning or losing against specific competitors. Essential for targeted brand positioning strategies.

### Custom Sentiments

Track performance on your industry-specific sentiment dimensions.

**What you're seeing**: Your custom sentiment scores over time compared to competitors.

**What it means**: How AI models perceive you on the attributes most important to your business and industry.

**Why it matters**: These metrics often correlate most directly with business outcomes since they reflect what matters most in your market.

### Brand Summary

See which sentiments each brand performs best and worst on.

**What you're seeing**:

- **Top sentiments**: Where each brand ranks #1 most often

**What it means**: Each brand's perception "signature" - their strongest and weakest associations.

**Why it matters**: Understand your competitive positioning and identify opportunities to own specific sentiment territories.

### Score Breakdown
