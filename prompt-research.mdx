Prompt Research is an advanced feature that helps you discover which AI prompts mention your brand across a comprehensive set of industry-relevant queries. Unlike daily reports that track a fixed set of prompts over time, Prompt Research generates 500+ prompts related to your brand and provides a one-time snapshot of your performance across all of them.

<Info>
  Prompt Research is available on paid plans. It runs as a background process and typically completes within a few hours. [Upgrade to access](/plans)

- **Optimize tracking**: Select the most valuable prompts to add to your daily tracking
- **Understand positioning**: See where you rank across hundreds of industry queries
- **Find opportunities**: Discover emerging topics and queries where you could improve

## Understanding Your Results

When you open Prompt Research, you'll see four key metrics at the top that summarize your brand's performance across all analyzed prompts:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Prompts Analyzed" icon="list">
    The total number of prompts that were generated and queried across all AI models. This typically ranges from 500-1000 prompts depending on your industry.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mention Rate" icon="percent">
    The percentage of prompts where your brand was mentioned at all. This represents your overall "share of voice" across the comprehensive prompt set.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Average Rank" icon="chart-line">
    When your brand is mentioned, this shows your typical ranking position across all prompts (1 = first place, 10 = tenth place).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rank 1 Mentions" icon="trophy">
    The number of times your brand was ranked first across all prompts. This indicates how often AI models consider you the top choice for industry queries.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Interpreting Your Metrics

**Mention Rate benchmarks:**

- **70%+**: Excellent brand awareness across diverse queries
- **50-69%**: Good presence with room for expansion
- **30-49%**: Moderate visibility, significant growth opportunities
- **Below 30%**: Limited presence, consider prompt strategy refinement

**Average Rank benchmarks:**

- **1-3**: Strong competitive positioning
- **4-6**: Moderate positioning with improvement opportunities
- **7-10**: Lower positioning, investigate competitor strategies

<Tip>
  Compare your Rank 1 mentions to your total mentions to understand how often you're seen as a category leader versus just a viable option.

## Exploring Prompt Data

The Prompt Data section lets you explore individual prompts and their performance. You can search, filter, and export the data to find the most valuable prompts for your tracking strategy.

### Search and Filter Options

**Search for prompts**

Use the search bar to find specific queries by keyword. For example, search for "enterprise" to find all prompts related to enterprise solutions.

**Filter by topic**

Prompts are automatically categorized by topic (e.g., features, use cases, audience segments). Filter by topic to focus on specific areas of your business.

**Filter by brand**

See prompts where specific competitors are mentioned. This helps you understand where competitors are gaining visibility and identify competitive gaps.

**Export to CSV**

Download the complete dataset for deeper analysis, reporting, or sharing with your team. The export includes all columns and metrics.

### Understanding Table Columns

The prompt data table shows several key pieces of information for each prompt:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Prompt** | The actual query text that was sent to AI models. Click on any prompt to see detailed results including which competitors appeared and their rankings. |
| **Relevance** | A visual indicator showing how relevant this prompt is to your brand and industry. Higher relevance scores indicate prompts that are more central to your business and should be prioritized for tracking. |
| **Status** | Shows whether your brand was mentioned in responses to this prompt: **Mentioned** (your brand appeared) or **Not Mentioned** (no AI models included your brand). |
| **Rank** | When your status is "Mentioned," this column shows your ranking position. The rank represents your average or most common position across AI models that mentioned you. |
| **Competitors** | Shows how many other brands were mentioned alongside yours (e.g., "10 mentioned"). Click this number to see the full list of competitors and their rankings for this prompt. |
| **Rank #1** | Displays which brand ranked first most frequently for this prompt. This helps you identify market leaders for specific queries and understand competitive dynamics. |
| **Tracking** | Click the "Track" button to add this prompt to your daily tracking. The prompt will be included in your next daily report and tracked over time going forward. |

<Warning>
  Once you add a prompt to tracking, it counts toward your plan's prompt limit. You cannot immediately remove prompts after adding them, so choose strategically.
</Warning>

## Analyzing Individual Prompts

### Viewing Detailed Results

Click on any prompt text or competitor count to open a detailed view showing:

- Complete AI model responses for that prompt
- Exact rankings across each AI model
- Full list of competitors mentioned
- Position of your brand (if mentioned)
- Context from the AI responses

This detailed view helps you understand:

- Why certain brands rank higher
- What context AI models use when discussing your industry
- How different AI models prioritize brands differently
- Competitive messaging and positioning patterns

### Identifying High-Value Prompts to Track

Not all prompts are created equal. Focus on these types when deciding what to add to your daily tracking:

**Strong performance prompts**

- Status: Mentioned
- Rank: 1-3
- High relevance score

These show where you're already strong and should maintain visibility over time.

**Opportunity prompts**

- Status: Mentioned
- Rank: 4-8
- High relevance score

These indicate areas where you could improve with focused effort.

**Competitive intelligence prompts**

- Strong competitors ranked highly
- Your brand mentioned but lower ranked
- High relevance to your target market

These help you track competitor positioning in key areas.

**Blind spot prompts**

- Status: Not Mentioned
- High relevance score
- Multiple competitors mentioned

These reveal where competitors have visibility but you don't—critical gaps to address.

## Strategic Use Cases

### Building Your Initial Prompt Set

If you're new to Trakkr or starting fresh with prompts, use Prompt Research to:

1. Identify 10-15 prompts where you already rank well (maintain strengths)
2. Add 5-10 prompts where competitors dominate (track competitive threats)
3. Include 5-10 prompts where you're not mentioned but should be (growth opportunities)

### Expanding Coverage

For existing Trakkr users, Prompt Research helps you find new topic areas or audience segments you're not currently tracking, discover trending queries or emerging categories in your industry, identify seasonal or contextual prompts relevant to specific campaigns, and fill gaps in your prompt coverage.

### Competitive Analysis

Use Prompt Research to understand which competitors appear most frequently across all prompts, identify niche players or emerging competitors you weren't tracking, see which queries competitors dominate and why, and benchmark your mention rate against the competitive landscape.

### Content Strategy Insights

Prompt Research reveals what questions people ask about your industry, how AI models categorize and describe your market, which features, benefits, and use cases are most associated with your category, and language and terminology patterns in AI responses.

## Best Practices

**Don't track everything**

Focus on 20-30 high-value prompts rather than trying to track all 500+. Quality over quantity ensures you can act on the data.

**Balance prompt types**

Include a mix of prompts where you're strong, prompts where you're competitive, and prompts where you have growth opportunities.

**Consider relevance scores**

Prioritize highly relevant prompts that align with your target market and business goals.

**Review competitor patterns**

If the same competitors appear across many prompts, they're your true competitive set. Focus on prompts where they're mentioned.

**Re-run periodically**

Run Prompt Research every 3-6 months to discover new prompts, emerging trends, and changing competitive dynamics.

**Export for analysis**

Use the CSV export to analyze patterns, share insights with stakeholders, or track changes between research runs.

## Understanding Relevance Scoring

Relevance scores help you prioritize which prompts matter most to your brand. We calculate relevance based on:

- How closely the prompt aligns with your industry and product category
- Whether the prompt targets your typical customer segments
- How specific or broad the query is relative to your positioning
- Historical performance of similar prompts in your tracking

Higher relevance scores indicate prompts that are more central to your business strategy and where visibility changes would have greater impact.
