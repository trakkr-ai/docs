Your Trakkr dashboard provides comprehensive insights into your AI brand visibility. This guide helps you navigate reports, understand the data, and track your performance over time.

## Dashboard Overview

When you log into Trakkr, your main dashboard shows current performance and trends at a glance. The large numbers represent your current Visibility Score (like "88.1") and Presence Score (like "83.3%"), each with green or red arrows indicating changes from your previous report. These metrics are accompanied by trend lines that show your performance trajectory over time, making it easy to spot whether you're improving or declining.

The dashboard also highlights your best performing model, which tells you which AI platform ranks you highest. This insight helps you understand platform-specific strengths and model preferences that might inform your content strategy.

### Visual Trend Charts

Two key charts dominate your dashboard view. The Visibility Over Time chart shows your visibility score history as a line graph, helping you identify improvement or decline patterns and understand the impact of prompt changes or market shifts. Similarly, the Presence Over Time chart tracks mention frequency trends, indicating whether your brand awareness is growing or declining and revealing any seasonal or cyclical patterns in your industry.

## Detailed Report Sections

### Reports List

The [Reports section](https://trakkr.ai/reports) functions as your historical performance archive. Each row represents one daily report, showing the visibility and presence scores for that specific date alongside a "View" button for detailed breakdown. This historical view enables trend analysis where you can compare scores across different dates, identify your best and worst performing periods, and spot patterns or anomalies in your data.

### Individual Report Analysis

Clicking "View" on any report reveals a detailed breakdown with several key sections. The Model Summary shows how you performed across each AI platform, revealing consistent performers that always rank you well, variable performers with inconsistent results, weak performers that rarely mention you or rank you poorly, and opportunity areas where competitors significantly outperform you.

#### Prompt Summary

Each of your tracking prompts receives individual performance metrics. High-performing prompts typically show visibility scores of 80+ indicating strong positioning, with presence scores of 80%+ demonstrating consistent mentions. These prompts align well with your brand strength and represent your competitive advantages.

Medium-performing prompts fall in the 50-79 score range, showing moderate performance that may indicate competitive markets or positioning opportunities. These are worth analyzing for competitor performance patterns.

Low-performing prompts with scores below 50 suggest challenges that may stem from prompts being too broad, too narrow, or falling outside your market strength. Consider editing or replacing these prompts to better capture your brand's positioning.

#### Query View - Detailed Results

The Query View provides the most granular insight, showing exact AI model responses. Understanding rankings becomes crucial here: a 1st position means the AI model listed you first, while 5th position indicates you appeared fifth in the response. If you're not mentioned, you didn't appear in that model's top 10 results.

The Brand Mentions pop-up, accessible by clicking "Details," shows the complete ranked list with exactly which brands appeared and in what order. This reveals your competitive context for each query and provides key insights about which competitors consistently outrank you, what context or framing generates better results, and how different AI models prioritize brands differently.

## Competitors Section

### Competitor Presence Scores

The Competitors tab shows other brands mentioned alongside yours, organized by their presence strength. High-presence competitors appearing in 60%+ of responses represent brands consistently mentioned across prompts and form your primary competitive set in AI conversations. Focus your competitive analysis on these brands.

Medium-presence competitors (30-59%) are regularly mentioned but not dominant, often strong in specific niches or contexts. Watch these for trends to see if they're gaining or losing ground. Low-presence competitors under 30% are occasionally mentioned brands that may be emerging competitors, niche players, or represent future threats or opportunities.

### Automatic Competitor Discovery

Trakkr automatically identifies competitors through mention frequency, requiring brands to appear in 2+ reports alongside yours to ensure consistent competitive relationships and filter out one-off mentions or irrelevant brands. The system also considers contextual relevance, noting when AI models mention them in similar industry contexts, which suggests real competitive relationships and helps discover competitors you might not actively track.

<Note>
  The "Coming soon" message for competitor visibility tracking indicates this feature is in development. Currently, you can see competitor presence but not their individual visibility scores.

## Report Generation and Timing

### Daily Report Schedule

Reports generate automatically every day at a consistent time, including all your active prompts and processing results from all 6 AI models. Processing time is typically quite fast: initial setup reports run immediately and complete in about 30 seconds, while daily reports usually finish within 2 minutes. Complex prompt sets may take slightly longer.

### When Reports Update

New prompts you add will appear in the next daily report, though there's no way to trigger immediate report generation. Plan your prompt changes knowing they take effect the following day. When you modify existing prompts, the edited versions appear in subsequent reports while historical data remains unchanged for consistency, allowing you to track the impact of prompt improvements over time.

As data accumulates, you'll notice that more historical information improves trend analysis quality. Weekly and monthly patterns become visible over time, and seasonal trends emerge with longer tracking periods.

## Analyzing Performance Trends

### Identifying Patterns

Improvement trends show consistently rising visibility or presence scores, which may indicate successful brand building, market expansion, or correlation with marketing campaigns and product launches. Conversely, decline patterns with falling scores may indicate increased competition, market changes, or reduced brand focus. Analyze which prompts or models show the biggest drops to understand the source of decline.

Many industries exhibit seasonal variations. B2B software companies may see fluctuations around budget cycles, while consumer brands often vary with shopping seasons. Understanding these patterns helps distinguish between concerning trends and natural market rhythms.

### Comparative Analysis

Period-over-period comparison involves examining current month versus previous month performance, looking at quarter-over-quarter trends, and making annual comparisons that show long-term brand health. Prompt-level analysis asks which prompts consistently perform best or worst, whether certain topics or contexts are stronger for your brand, and how prompt modifications affect performance.

Model-level insights reveal whether certain AI models consistently favor your brand, identify models where competitors significantly outperform you, and show how consistent your performance is across different platforms.

## Using Reports for Strategic Decisions

### Content Strategy Optimization

Your report data directly informs content strategy decisions. Double down on topics where you score well, create more content around successful prompt themes, and leverage your strengths in marketing messaging. For improvement opportunities, address areas where competitors consistently outrank you, develop content for prompts where you're rarely mentioned, and consider thought leadership in weak performance areas.

### Competitive Intelligence

Reports provide comprehensive market position assessment, helping you understand your relative position in AI conversations, identify market leaders and emerging threats, and track competitor momentum over time. Positioning insights reveal what context AI models associate with your brand, help discover new competitive sets you weren't aware of, and show how your market is categorized by AI.

### Brand Monitoring

Use presence scores to gauge overall brand awareness, track which contexts and audiences know your brand, and identify gaps in brand recognition. For reputation management, understand how AI models position your brand, monitor for changes in competitive context, and track the impact of PR campaigns or market events.

## Troubleshooting Report Issues

### Low or Zero Scores

Common causes include prompts that may be too broad or narrow for your market position, brands that may not be well-known in AI training data, competitors with stronger online presence or recognition, and prompts that may not align with how customers actually discover your brand.

For diagnostic steps, review individual prompt performance to identify patterns, check if the issue spans all models or affects specific ones, analyze competitor performance for context, and consider whether prompts reflect real customer scenarios.

### Inconsistent Performance

Some variation is normal since different AI models have different training data and preferences. Day-to-day variation is expected and normal, and seasonal or market factors can cause fluctuations. However, investigate sudden dramatic drops in performance, consistent decline over multiple weeks, and significant discrepancies between similar prompts.

### Data Export Options

Current export capabilities include using the "Export" button in your account settings and choosing "Detailed view" for comprehensive data that includes historical performance across all metrics. Export use cases include sharing reports with team members or stakeholders, analyzing data in external tools like Excel, creating custom visualizations or presentations, and archiving historical performance data.
