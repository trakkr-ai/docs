</Info>

Content Optimization analyzes individual pages on your website to understand how well AI models can comprehend, extract, and cite your content. Unlike Technical Audit (which focuses on site structure and crawlability), Content Optimization dives deep into your actual content—what you're saying, how you're saying it, and whether AI models can easily extract and reference that information.

The result is a detailed report showing exactly what's working, what's missing, and how to transform your content into citation-worthy material that AI models prefer to recommend.

## Why Content Optimization Matters

AI models don't just crawl your site—they need to understand it deeply enough to confidently cite it when answering user questions. Content Optimization reveals:

- **What AI models extract** from your pages (entities, facts, metrics)
- **How well you answer** common questions in your space
- **Where you're missing** citable snippets and structured information
- **Specific content improvements** that increase AI citation likelihood
- **External opportunities** to amplify your content's reach

Think of it as optimizing for AI comprehension the same way you'd optimize content for human readers—clarity, structure, facts, and answers.

## Getting Started

### Starting a New Analysis

Navigate to Content Optimization and choose how you want to analyze your content:

## Understanding Your Content Report

Each page report contains comprehensive insights about how AI models perceive and can use your content.

[image]

### Summary Metrics

At the top, you'll see four key metrics for this specific page:

**Answer-First Score**

Measures how quickly and clearly your content answers likely questions. Higher scores indicate your content is structured to provide direct answers that AI models can easily extract and cite.

**Improvement Potential**

Shows how much opportunity exists to enhance this page for AI citations. Higher percentages indicate more room for optimization—think of this as your growth ceiling.

**Query Coverage**

The percentage of relevant queries that your page is well-equipped to answer. AI models simulate various questions people might ask about your topic and assess whether your content addresses them.

**Schema Coverage**

How complete your page's structured data implementation is. Higher percentages mean AI models have better semantic understanding of your content through proper schema markup.

### Page Context

You'll also see:

- **Page type**: Auto-detected page category (Homepage, Product page, Blog post, etc.)
- **User stage**: Where users typically are in their journey when viewing this page
- **Sophistication level**: Content complexity assessment

These help Trakkr tailor recommendations to your specific page type and audience.

## Priority Actions

The Priority Actions section shows ranked recommendations for improving your content's AI cite-ability.

[image]

Each action includes:

- **Impact level**: How much this change could improve AI understanding and citations
- **Effort level**: How difficult this is to implement (High/Low)

Click on any action to expand and see:

**Insight**

Why this matters for AI models and what problem it solves. This explains how LLMs and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) crawlers process content and why this specific improvement helps.

**Current Content**

What your page currently has (or doesn't have) related to this issue.

**Ideal Content**

What AI models would prefer to see—the target state for this improvement.

**Implementation Steps**

Specific, actionable instructions for making the change. These are often code examples, content templates, or step-by-step guides you can hand to your development or content teams.

<Tip>
  Actions are prioritized to show high-impact improvements first. Start at the top and work your way down for the most efficient optimization.
</Tip>

### Common Action Types

**Structured Data Improvements**

Adding or enhancing JSON-LD schema for products, articles, organizations, FAQs, etc. This gives AI models explicit semantic understanding of your content.

**Content Format Enhancements**

Restructuring content to be more answer-friendly—adding lists, tables, clear headings, FAQ sections, and explicit answers.

**Entity and Metric Addition**

Including specific data points, metrics, and entities that AI models look for when determining cite-ability and authority.

**Clarity and Specificity**

Replacing vague descriptors with concrete facts, adding missing information, and making implicit knowledge explicit.

## Citation Potential

The Citation Potential section shows how easily AI models can cite your content and what barriers might prevent them from doing so.

[image]

### Citable Snippets

Green checkmarks indicate content elements that are already in citation-friendly formats:

- Direct quotes or statements AI models can extract cleanly
- Well-structured facts with proper context
- Clear answers to specific questions
- Properly formatted data that's easy to reference

These are your strengths—content that AI models already find valuable and cite-able.

### Citation Barriers

Orange warnings indicate issues that make it harder for AI models to cite your content:

- Vague language that lacks specificity
- Missing context or supporting data
- Important information buried in dense paragraphs
- Lack of structured formats (lists, tables, FAQs)

These need attention to improve your citation likelihood.

### Missing Metrics

Click "View missing metrics" to see specific quantifiable data that AI models look for but couldn't find on your page:

**Vague descriptors**: Words like "best," "curated," "featured," "new" that should be replaced with specific, measurable facts

**Missing metrics**: Specific data points AI models prioritize when evaluating content authority and cite-ability (prices, quantities, ratings, timeframes, etc.)

**Quantification opportunities**: Areas where you could add concrete numbers or data to strengthen your content

Adding these metrics makes your content more authoritative and citation-worthy in AI model evaluations.

### Fact Density Score

Shows how rich your content is in concrete, citable facts versus general statements. Higher scores indicate more substance that AI models can extract and reference.

## Query Coverage

Query Coverage shows how well your page answers various types of questions AI models might encounter about your topic.

[image]

### Understanding Query Simulations

Trakkr simulates relevant queries based on your page content—the kinds of questions real users ask AI models. For each query, you'll see:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Query** | The simulated question or search query |
| **Intent** | The type of question (Navigational, Informational, Transactional, Commercial) |
| **Coverage** | How well your page can answer this query (visualized with a progress bar) |
| **Priority** | How important this query type is (High/Medium/Low) |
| **Missing Elements** | Specific content needed to fully answer this query |

### Query Intent Types

**Navigational**

Queries where users are looking for a specific page or brand (e.g., "Company X official website"). High coverage means your page clearly identifies itself and provides expected navigation information.

**Informational**

Queries seeking knowledge or answers (e.g., "How does X work?", "What is Y?"). High coverage means your content provides comprehensive answers to these questions.

**Transactional**

Queries indicating purchase intent (e.g., "Buy X", "X pricing"). High coverage means transaction-related information is clear and accessible.

**Commercial**

Queries for product research and comparison (e.g., "Best X for Y", "X vs Y"). High coverage means your page helps users make informed purchasing decisions.

### Improving Query Coverage

Focus on queries with:

- **Low coverage** but **High priority** - These represent gaps in critical areas
- **Missing elements** that are easy to add - Quick wins that improve coverage

Missing elements show exactly what content or formatting would improve your ability to answer that query.

## Entity Extraction

Entity Extraction shows what structured information AI models can successfully extract from your page—and how confident they are in that extraction.

[image]

### Extraction Metrics

**Extraction Quality**

A score indicating how cleanly and accurately AI models can extract entities from your content. Higher scores mean your content is structured in ways that make extraction reliable.

**High Confidence Entities**

The number of entities AI models can extract with high confidence. These are facts, data points, and structured information that models trust and can cite.

### Extracted Entities

The report shows specific entities found on your page, grouped by type:

- **Entity type**: The category of information (product_prices, company_name, contact_information, etc.)
- **Entity values**: The actual data extracted
- **Confidence score**: How certain the AI model is about this extraction

**Example entity types**:
- Product prices and specifications
- Company information
- Contact details
- Location data
- Payment methods supported
- Product inventory indicators
- Review and rating data
- And many more depending on your page content

Tags highlighted in green indicate entities that were successfully extracted with high confidence. These are your well-structured data points that AI models can reliably reference.

### Warning Signs

Orange warning boxes indicate extraction issues:

- Implicit information that should be made explicit
- Missing structured data that would improve extraction
- Ambiguous formatting that reduces confidence
- Context gaps that make extraction unreliable

Addressing these warnings improves how much usable information AI models can extract from your page.

<Note>
  The entities shown are based on your specific page content and type. Product pages show different entities than blog posts or service pages.
</Note>

## External Opportunities

External Opportunities suggests platforms and content angles for promoting your page externally, which can boost citations and authority signals for AI models.

[image]

### Platform Suggestions

Based on your page content and industry, Trakkr suggests relevant external platforms where your content could gain visibility:

- **Social platforms** (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- **Community sites** (Product Hunt, Medium, Reddit, etc.)
- **Industry-specific platforms** relevant to your niche

Each suggestion includes:

**Content Angle**

A specific hook or perspective for sharing your content on that platform—tailored to what resonates with that audience.

**Engagement Strategy**

Recommended tactics for maximizing visibility and engagement on that platform, such as:
- Types of content to post
- How to structure the message
- Engagement approaches that work well
- Follow-up strategies

### Why External Promotion Matters

When your content appears on high-authority external sites:

- **AI models discover it** through citations and links from trusted sources
- **Authority signals increase** as multiple reputable sites reference your content
- **Citation likelihood improves** because models see your content validated by external sources
- **Broader discovery** means more opportunities for AI models to encounter and cite your work

Think of external opportunities as amplifying your content's reach beyond your own domain.

## Using Content Optimization Strategically

### Start with High-Value Pages

Don't try to optimize every page at once. Focus on:

1. **Homepage** - Your primary brand introduction
2. **Top landing pages** - Pages that drive traffic or conversions
3. **Key product/service pages** - Your main offerings
4. **Popular blog posts** - Content that already gets traction

### Prioritize Actions by Impact and Effort

Within each page report, focus on:

- **High impact + Low effort** first - Quick wins with meaningful results
- **High impact + High effort** second - Significant improvements worth the investment
- **Low impact** actions last - Only if you've handled higher priorities

### Balance Quick Wins with Deep Work

**Quick wins** might be:
- Adding specific metrics to replace vague language
- Formatting existing content into lists or tables
- Adding FAQ sections with questions you already answer
- Implementing basic schema markup

**Deeper work** includes:
- Creating comprehensive content to fill major query coverage gaps
- Extensive structured data implementation
- Rewriting sections for clarity and cite-ability
- Developing entirely new content types (comparison tables, detailed guides, etc.)

### Integrate with Technical Audit

For best results, use both tools together:

1. **Run Technical Audit first** to fix crawlability, rendering, and technical SEO issues
2. **Then run Content Optimization** to improve what AI models understand once they can access your content
3. **Technical Audit** ensures AI models can find and read your pages
4. **Content Optimization** ensures they understand and cite what they find

<Tip>
  Technical barriers prevent AI models from accessing content. Content issues prevent them from understanding and citing it. Fix both for maximum AI visibility.
</Tip>

### Track Your Improvements

While individual analysis scores aren't tracked over time, you can:

- Run analysis before implementing changes, save results
- Implement recommended actions
- Run analysis again on the same pages
- Compare scores and improvements manually

Keep records of your analyses to demonstrate progress and validate which optimizations deliver results.

## Best Practices

**Don't optimize in a vacuum**

Look at query coverage to understand what questions users actually ask, then optimize to answer those questions—not arbitrary improvements.

**Combine actions when possible**

Many improvements overlap. For example, adding structured data often addresses multiple actions at once (entity extraction, schema coverage, citable snippets).

**Make content explicit**

AI models can't infer or "read between the lines" as well as humans. Make your expertise, data, and answers explicit and direct.

**Add concrete metrics**

Replace vague language ("fast delivery," "competitive pricing") with specifics ("2-day shipping," "$49.99 starting price"). AI models strongly prefer concrete facts.

**Structure for extraction**

Use lists, tables, clear headings, and FAQ formats. These make it easy for AI models to extract and cite specific information.

**Test your changes**

After implementing improvements, run Content Optimization again to see if your scores improve and actions are resolved.

**Focus on answer-first structure**

Especially for informational content, lead with direct answers then provide supporting details. AI models look for this pattern when deciding what to cite.
